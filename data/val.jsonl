{"text": "Democrat Anthony Gemma added 400,000 Twitter followers in February, R.I. candidate questioned on Twitter\n\nA primary challenger in a tight Rhode Island congressional race has nearly 1 million Twitter followers — more than Mitt Romney — but he's not talking about how he amassed such a staggering social media fan base in a short span of time.\n\nIn February alone, Democrat Anthony Gemma, who is running even in polls against first-term Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), added 400,000 Twitter followers, according to social media monitoring sites. On Facebook, meanwhile, fans of his campaign page ballooned from 3,414 to 107,614 during the same time period.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGemma now has more than 519,000 Facebook fans —10 times more fans than the number of votes he received in his 2010 primary loss to Cicilline. It's a seat Patrick Kennedy held for eight terms in a heavily Democratic area, and this time Gemma has a better shot because Cicilline's approval ratings are spectacularly low.\n\nBut the small-town plumbing executive and self-described \"social media guru\" declined through his campaign staff to explain how he accumulated so many social media followers so fast. \"The campaign does not comment on our social media strategy,\" campaign spokesman Alex Morash said in an email.\n\nOther candidates recently have been caught up in allegations that their campaigns were buying Twitter followers, including Romney and Newt Gingrich. That's relatively easy to do online, costs only pennies apiece and is not illegal — only in violation of Facebook and Twitter terms of service.\n\nBut an oversized social footprint that suggests mass appeal can be embarrassing for a campaign should it be revealed.\n\n\"If a candidate abuses the appropriate channels to gin up their followings, they risk hurting their reputation as a grass-roots candidate,\" said Amy Brown, a digital campaign strategist with Harris Media LLC who has worked with several national candidates.\n\nFewer than 1 percent of Gemma's Twitter followers are based in Rhode Island, but 14 percent are in Canada, according to Michael Hussey, CEO of PeekAnalytics, one of two independent social media research firms that provided POLITICO data on Gemma. Many of his followers' profile photos are racy and their hometowns include cities such as Istanbul and Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nFurthermore, Gemma seems to have a surprisingly low level of engagement. On Feb. 24, the same day he picked up more than 87,000 followers, he asked his audience to retweet a photo; only six did.\n\n\"This is a Rhode Island politician,\" Hussey said. \"Why would a Rhode Island politician who nobody knows outside of the Providence metropolitan area have 2 percent of his followers from London or 3 percent to the state of Georgia?\"\n\nWildfire Social Media Marketing, a firm that \"scrapes\" Facebook and Twitter daily to log changes in thousands of accounts, shows that the Twitter handle @ AnthonyGemma gained more than 400,000 followers in February alone — despite a modest amount of tweeting and no watershed event to precipitate it.\n\nGemma's account now has about 968,000 followers, more than the presumed GOP presidential nominee Romney, who has about 825,000.\n\nLikewise, the Facebook page for \"Anthony Gemma For Congress\" experienced a whopping 31-fold increase in the same span. His personal page, Anthony Gemma, did even better, skyrocketing by Feb. 29 to 169,468 fans, up 5,600 percent from the end of January.\n\nBy the time Gemma announced his candidacy in mid-April, Gemma had just over 1 million Twitter followers. His personal Facebook page had 338,000 fans and the campaign had 107,000 fans.

{"text": "New \"fitness-to-teach\" hearings will be held in public as standard, Minister for Education Jan O'Sullivan has announced, overruling a recommendation of the professional body for teachers.\n\nThe Teaching Council, two third of which is made up of teachers and their union representatives, had proposed that a sub-committee would be charged with deciding on a case by case basis whether the long-awaited fitness hearings would be held in public or private.\n\nHowever, the Minister said she intended to introduce an amendment to the Teaching Council Amendment Bill, 2014, to provide for the hearings to be held in public \"as the default position\".\n\nShe said exceptions would be made where necessary \"to protect the rights of individuals\" and she would seek the council's advice on factors that could be considered in such cases.\n\n\"This will ensure that the new fitness to teach framework will mirror best practice as regards disciplinary hearings for other professional bodies.\"\n\nThe announcement is expected to draw a strong reaction from teacher unions, already warring with the Minster over junior cycle reforms.\n\nWhile teachers in other jurisdictions have long had a system of public hearings by default, the Teaching Council argued that public hearings should only take place here when there was agreement on the matter from all parties to an inquiry.\n\nAmong the arguments the council put forward to justify this advice to the Minister was that \"Ireland is a small place and the fact that a teacher is up before a panel will be widely known with the potential for an impact on their reputation even if no finding is made against them\".\n\nThe fitness hearings are due to take place later this year under the auspices of the council. Under the new legislation, which is published before the Oireachtas this week, the council will have the capacity to remove a teacher from its register where it deems the person unfit to teach, including where this is for child protection reasons.\n\nThe council will also be charged with investigating underperformance or conduct issues on foot of complaints from students, parents and teachers, among others.\n\nOnly issues \"of sufficient gravity\" will result in an inquiry. Those against whom decisions are made may be suspended from the register or receive a sanction of \"advice, admonishment or censure\".\n\nThe Bill also makes provision for retrospective Garda vetting and periodic re-vetting of all registered teachers.\n\nFigures from the Teaching Council last October showed that about 40 per cent of its 90,000 registered teachers had yet to be Garda vetted. The Minster said she understood it was the council's intention to prioritise this work in the year after enactment of the new legislation.\n\nStatutory vetting arrangements will, in addition to the existing check for criminal offences, also include a check for any relevant \"soft information\".

{"text": "By Cedric Hendrix\n\nCHICAGO — The curtain rose on Progtoberfest III right on schedule. The experience of listening to three dozen bands over three days is akin to being taught to swim by being thrown into the deep end of the pool. The key is not to panic and let the experience overwhelm you.\n\nThis is particularly true when dealing with progressive rock and related bands. Three dozen bands throwing around a LOT of trippy notes in a LOT of odd time signatures is more than the average Top 40 fan can take. But the crowd gathered at Reggie's knew the deal. They settled down and dug in with relish. It was clear the bands were feeding off the energy they got from the audience.\n\nHere are some highlights from Day One …\n\nSons of Ra got the ball rolling in the Music Joint, bringing their blend of jazz, fusion, metal, and prog forth in the form of an aggressive power trio. Guitarist Erik Oldman, bassist Keith Wakefield, and drummer Mark D. blazed through their set, in support of their EP, Anthropology. They also did a nice uptempo take on the King Crimson classic \"Red.\" The band's live performance showed just how far they'd come since he release of the EP last year. This is a band on the rise.\n\nEchoes of Giants were the first to play in the Rock Club. The Columbia, Missouri band used rock-solid instrumental ability (particularly the guitar of Wes Bolton) and the soaring voice of lead vocalist Joey Meyers to get the show off to a great start. I wound up leaving with a copy of their CD, At the End of Myself. A supreme effort.\n\nConscious Pilot blew in from Columbus, Ohio to put on their display of trippy chops in support of their latest effort, Autopilot. The band's groove fit in perfectly with the festival's settings, featuring highly skilled guitar and keyboard pyrotechnics. It was progressive rock with a jam band attitude.\n\nSchooltree, from Boston, could be identified as musical cousins of another young Boston band, Bent Knee. Their songs were epic, yet accessible, filled with unique keyboard motifs and tricky time shifts. Band chemistry was tight, and the musicians seemed very comfortable, regardless of where the music went.\n\nFive of the Eyes absolutely blew the doors off the Music Joint! The Portland, Maine band played with the fire of the Mars Volta and the swagger of The Rolling Stones, with elements of Radiohead and the Foo Fighters thrown in for good measure. It's not easy to be a prog rock superstar, but it wouldn't be a bad bet to invest in this band. They are going places!\n\nChicago's own District 97 brought the heaviest sound of the afternoon, tearing through a blistering set that not only showed off the band's formidable chops, but the vocal skills and sex appeal of Leslie Hunt, a rare commodity in the prog rock genre. As an added bonus, the band broke out a marvelous version of King Crimson's \"Starless.\" Classy and classic.\n\nNew Jersey's In the Presence of Wolves unleashed a hyperkinetic, odd-metered, metallic musical odyssey on its audience in the Music Joint. Recognizing they were in the smaller venue, lead vocalist Chris Capatanio was determined to make the most of it. \"Small stage, lots of rage,\" he declared as the band tore through songs from their latest album, Of Two Minds.\n\nDave Kerzner (also know for his work with Sounds of Contact) took the Rock Club to a higher plane with his soaring, orchestral sound reminiscent of Pink Floyd in its prime. His top flight band, featuring extraordinary guitarist Fernando Perdomo, made the most of Kerzner's extraordinary compositions from his solo albums New World and Static.\n\nSantiago, Chile's Aisles wrapped up their U.S. tour — and made its first Chicago appearance — on the Music Joint stage. The band brought a smoldering intensity at the absolute PERFECT volume. The band played heavy, epic prog-pop with just the right melodic touch. The musicians were clearly skilled, but they also made this evident without seeming to show off, which is not always the easiest thing to do.\n\nWhat can you say about a legend that hasn't been said a thousand times before? With a resume that includes stints in Weather Report, Santana, and Jazz is Dead, bassist Alphonso Johnson had had nearly every superlative imaginable tossed his way over the past five decades. Let's just say he was all that, and then some. Equally legendary drummer Chester Thompson held down the backbeat as only he could. Emerging guitarist Nili Brosh nearly stole the show with an impressive array of chops played over the band's Latin-tinged fusion. There's nothing like being in the presence of true professionals.\n\nThe day featured enough music to", "label": "real"}
{"text": "In an unusual step for districts facing a looming state accountability deadline, one rural district is completely overhauling its schools in an attempt to stave off state intervention.\n\nIn an effort to reverse years of low performance, Lake County School District, a central Colorado district that serves a slightly higher rate of impoverished students than Denver, is in the first stages of moving entirely away from its traditional academic model in its elementary and middle schools.\n\nThe elementary and middle schools will be joining a national coalition of so-called \"expeditionary learning\" schools, which focus on high-level thinking and real-world ties to classroom learning. If that's successful, district officials, with teacher approval, could bring the model to the high school in 2015-2016.\n\nLake County is among a number of struggling districts that the state has given a timeline to show dramatic improvement or face intervention. But, state officials and observers say, it is one of the first rural districts on that timeline to take a comprehensive, proactive approach to turnaround.\n\nA new direction, and a host of challenges\n\nTeachers at the district's elementary and middle school say that the adoption of the expeditionary learning model is a much-needed shift in direction, but the road to get to that decision has been rocky.\n\nDan Leonhard, a third grade teacher at West Park Elementary, remembers that when he first joined the district three years ago, teachers used a patchwork of strategies and materials that failed to get students thinking at high levels.\n\n\"Everyone just worked their tails off trying everything they knew and throwing everything they could at these kids,\" said Leonhard. \"It changed across levels, across teachers the way it would be taught.\"\n\nRise & Shine Colorado Get Colorado's most important education stories delivered to your inbox daily Subscribe \"Chalkbeat is my go-to education news source. Typically, Chalkbeat is the place to find out about district news before you hear about it anywhere else.\" — Amy M.\n\nAfter his first year, the school's scores actually declined. So last year, the district's new superintendent and Leonhard's former principal Wendy Wyman made changing classroom instruction her priority, talking to teachers and trying to get at the root cause of the district's low performance.\n\n\"We did a lot of walk-throughs of classrooms,\" said Wyman. \"One of the things we learned through that process is that we wanted more support for curriculum and instruction.\" Wyman started by bringing in both state and privately-run teacher trainings and by sending teachers to other districts to see what was working — or not.\n\nBut she wanted to make sure that any major changes were tailored to the particulars of the community, which includes Leadville, a popular outdoors destination.\n\n\"[It was] about coming up with a process that really matches who we are in Lake County,\" said Wyman.\n\nShe and school leaders started by making small adjustments, including hiring instructional coaches for the elementary schools and starting to adopt state exemplar curriculum.\n\nBut at first, the small changes just provoked more uncertainty for teachers. Teachers and the administration felt directionless as they tried one strategy after another.\n\n\"It was just ideas and ideas and ideas,\" said Leonhard. \"There was just kind of a cluster of things to do without a vision of where we're going to be.\"\n\nLooking at the possibility\n\nMany staff felt there were too many things that needed to be fixed to do it piecemeal; the district needed a wholesale, cohesive new direction. Several administrators, including Wyman's replacement as principal at West Park, Stephanie Gallegos, had experience with expeditionary learning and raised it as a possibility.\n\nStudents at expeditionary learning schools spend six months to a year completing a comprehensive unit on a single subject, known as an \"expedition,\" that crosses academic fields and culminates in a trip to a relevant location or in a visit by experts to the classroom.\n\nGallegos said the model just seemed right for the district, because of Leadville's mountainous location and the ability to pull in experts on real-world topics like mining and the ski industry.\n\nPlus, \"expeditionary learning has some of the best professional development I've ever had as a teacher,\" said Gallegos. She made educating her teachers in the model a top priority, even personally covering their classes so they could visit other schools or participate in trainings.\n\nThe national organization that coordinates expeditionary learning schools requires that any school adopting its model get approval from its teachers. When it came time to get the teacher go-ahead, Gallegos and Wyman's efforts paid off — teachers in the district's elementary and middle schools voted unanimously to adopt the model.\n\n\"As soon as that was solidified, there was a huge sigh of relief,\" said Leonhard.\n\nAlthough the official rollout doesn't start until next year, he and other teachers have already begun to use", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Canada's spy agency helped senior federal officials figure out how to deal with protests expected last summer in response to resource and energy development issues — including a pivotal decision on the Northern Gateway pipeline.\n\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service prepared advice and briefing material for two June meetings of the deputy ministers' committee on resources and energy, documents obtained under the Access to Information Act show.\n\nThe issue was driven by violence during demonstrations against natural-gas fracking in New Brunswick the previous summer and the government's interest in \"assuming a proactive approach\" in 2014, says a newly declassified memo from Tom Venner, CSIS assistant director for policy and strategic partnerships.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nRelease of the material comes amid widening concern among environmentalists and civil libertarians about the spy agency's role in gathering information on opponents of natural resource projects. Those worries have been heightened by proposed anti-terrorism legislation that would allow CSIS to go a step further and actively disrupt suspected extremist plots.\n\nTraditional aboriginal and treaty rights issues, including land use, persist across Canada, Venner said in the memo to CSIS director Michel Coulombe in advance of a June 9 meeting of deputy ministers.\n\n\"Discontent related to natural resource development across Canada is largely an extension of traditional concerns,\" he wrote. \"In British Columbia, this is primarily related to pipeline projects (such as Northern Gateway).\"\n\nOn June 17, the federal government conditionally approved Enbridge's proposed $8-billion Northern Gateway pipeline, which would see Alberta crude flow westward to Kitimat, B.C.\n\nPrior to the federal decision, Venner drafted a second memo for a follow-up meeting of the deputy ministers on June 19, in which he laid out CSIS assessments of three scenarios: approval, approval with aboriginal consultation, or rejection. Much of the content is blanked out.\n\nOther censored sections indicate that while CSIS believes most Northern Gateway opposition falls into the category of legitimate protest and dissent, it concludes some does not.\n\nPublic Safety Canada may lead deputy ministers in a guided discussion \"that will consider possible federal responses to protest and demonstration incidents,\" Venner added.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nPackages for both meetings included a CSIS synopsis of violence that flared near the Elsipogtog First Nation in New Brunswick in October 2013 when the RCMP enforced a provincial court injunction against an encampment to protest fracking — an underground rock-fracturing process to make gas and oil flow.\n\nThe spy agency's summary — portions of which remain secret — notes that during the raid and subsequent arrests, Molotov cocktails were thrown at Mounties, shots were fired from nearby woods and six RCMP cars were set afire.\n\nCSIS also gave deputy ministers a federal risk forecast for the 2014 \"spring / summer protest and demonstration season\" compiled by the Government Operations Centre, which tracks and analyzes such activity.\n\nCSIS spokeswoman Tahera Mufti did not respond to requests for comment on the newly disclosed documents.\n\nThe Elsipogtog conflict was a policing matter, not a threat to national security, said Keith Stewart, an energy campaigner for Greenpeace Canada.\n\n\"That was a very localized conflict,\" he said. \"And it was one that we've seen happen over and over again because we haven't dealt with land claims.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWith that in mind, Stewart was surprised by the degree of spy service involvement in the Northern Gateway discussions. \"I find it odd to see CSIS in the middle of this.\"\n\nThe records make it clear the intelligence service is putting \"extensive work\" into monitoring protest activity in the extractive sector across Canada, said human rights lawyer Paul Champ.\n\n\"The big question I have is, why are they producing these intelligence reports on protest activity they acknowledge is legitimate and outside their mandate?\"", "label": "real"}

His wife took a job in New York City, and Adams got a job there as a post-conviction litigation fellow with the Innocence Project there.\n\nAfter finishing law school, Adams spent most of the past year working in a dual clerkship with Judge Ann Claire Williams of the 7th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts of the Southern District of New York. He passed the New York Bar exam in February.\n\nAdams, 35, spent nearly eight years behind bars before his release in January 2007, after his lawyers persuaded the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that his trial lawyer provided ineffective counsel. Adams had maintained that he and two others had consensual sex with a woman in a college dormitory. His lawyer, the court found, failed to put on a witness who saw the woman, after the encounter, in a common area of the dorm with the three men, all of them smoking cigarettes. Adams's story was featured in the ABA Journal along with those of two other exonerees who went to law school after their convictions were determined to be wrongful and they were released.\n\nAdams' new employer, the Innocence Project, was launched in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld to use DNA evidence for proving wrongful convictions. Housed at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, it has been responsible for more than 300 exonerations.

Today the meeting was inconclusive.\n\nWhat we set out to do was the collection method, who will collect, for what category of taxes. There are 93 lakh of assesses, in all the three key taxes – excise, and sales tax. We dissected them into three parts, above Rs 1.5 crore, between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh crore and how many are below Rs 20 lakh, to get an idea about the workload. The five options were narrowed down to three options. Almost all the states wanted to keep a horizontal division of Rs 1.5 crore, below which the States will completely handle the taxes. Above Rs 1.5 crore, there will be cross empowerment, based on evaluating the risk profile of each client in this category and get allocated to either centre or the state government, based on a formula.\n\nThere was no consensus yet. Lots of other questions also raised. Out of the 93 lakh assesses, they disclosed that if we do Rs 20 lakh threshold, then almost 58 per cent of the assesses vanish. But they are arguing that IGST needs registration will bring in even the smallest transaction under assessment. We believe that very large number of people who are sub Rs 20 lakh in a particular stage, will move beyond Rs 20 lakh if different taxes getting added. So the whole threshold got a little revisited. We are now working on the revenue which comes into these four categories. The meeting is again on November 20, before which the fitment of the Goods and services to the slab structure by a team of secretaries.\n\nAre you satisfied with the decisions taken so far? Earlier, the State has raised issues related to the compensation. What is the current position?\n\n\nThe key decisions are yet to happen. We would be happy if the Rs 1.5 crore horizontal division, for all the taxes, happen. I have a belief that they may not have a choice. There are many states asking for this. We are not getting isolated as it happened in Rajya Sabha. We are now well supported.\n\nThe rates are in the same line with what the State asked for. Are you happy with that?\n\n\nThe rates are fine, but the thresholds are getting relooked at. So I don't think you should have a GST where half of it go away. They are yet to convince us that this will not shrink with this Rs 20 lakh threshold. The discussions were valuable, but we have to see the results to determine whether we are happy or not. More important than the rate is the collection, that who will collect what and which process will get owned. Will someone own only audit and enforcement or collection and scrutiny, those are the key questions being discussed. Those decisions will be taken only on November 20.\n\nDo you think that the processes are hastened through? Is it a concern?\n\n\nI am a believer that if you don't implement things quickly, the chance of implementing it well will be really low. I think it is possible before April, though the Constitutional Amendment gives you time till September 22, 2017. There is no chances a few states accepting and going ahead while others don't. It has to happen simultaneously. They are trying to do by April 1. It would be", "label": "real"}

{"text": "GUNMEN have killed 14 truck drivers and stolen their vehicles on a highway north of Baghdad, while dozens of other militants attacked a nearby town, a local administrative official says.\n\nThe gunmen killed the drivers on Thursday, about 10 kilometres south of the town of Sulaiman Bek, which had been under attack by militants since Wednesday night, Mohammed al-Bayati said. The ongoing fighting also left one civilian wounded, he said. Sulaiman Bek was briefly seized by militants in late April. The assailants later withdrew under a deal worked out by tribal leaders and government officials, allowing security forces to move back in. The seizure of the town came amid a surge of violence that began on April 23 when security forces moved in against anti-government protesters near the northern Sunni Arab town of Hawijah, sparking clashes that left 53 people dead. Dozens more died in a wave of subsequent unrest including revenge attacks against security forces. With the latest violence, more than 670 people have been killed in unrest in July, making it the deadliest month in a year marked by spiralling violence. Iraq has faced years of attacks by militants, but analysts say widespread discontent among members of its Sunni Arab minority, which the government has failed to address, has fuelled the surge in unrest this year.", "label": "real"}
{"text": "Mustafa Gurbuz\n\nOn the way back from the Sochi meetings with his Russian and Iranian counterparts, Turkey's President Erdoğan accused the United States of breaking its promise by continuing to send heavy weapons to the People's Protection Units (YPG), affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), despite the fact that the war on the Islamic State (IS) was coming to an end. Erdoğan cited reports on the heavy weapons deployment in Afrin—a Kurdish enclave that was encircled by Turkey-backed forces—adding that he would not rule out cooperating with the Assad regime against the YPG and its political representation, the Democratic Union Party (PYD). Erdoğan's statements were followed shortly by a phone call to US President Donald Trump, and Turkish officials stated that the United States agreed to cut the arms supply to the YPG. Surprised by Ankara's statements on behalf of Washington, the White House issued a press release to confirm the plans for the weapons cut-off without providing any details on timing. The White House, however, communicated an emphasis on post-IS stabilization, and thus, did not mention the possibility of the YPG returning arms previously supplied by the United States—which was Ankara's main demand.\n\nThe fall of Raqqa and the ensuing victories against the Islamic State in Deir Ezzor have not brought relief; instead, they posed the most puzzling questions for Washington, which has not developed a coherent vision for post-IS Syria. Loath to see an emboldened Assad regime that has strong relations with Tehran, US officials expressed their willingness to use the American military presence in northern Syria as a card to pressure Damascus as well as to counter Iran. Russia has outperformed the United States in diplomatic leadership for Syria's future; Washington's options are quite limited indeed. Perhaps the most critical decision that awaits the Trump Administration is the nature of US-PYD relations in post-IS Syria.\n\nWill Washington perceive the Syrian Kurdish cantons as its military outposts, reminiscent of Iraqi Kurdistan after Operation Desert Storm in 1991? Unless the United States accomplishes the daunting task of satisfying both Turkey and the Kurds, the Kurdish cantons will be economically dependent on the Assad regime, which will hamper the PYD's dreams of autonomy.\n\nWill Washington Use the Kurds against Iran?\n\nThe Syrian Army's recent victory in Boukamal, a strategic city next to the Iraqi border, is widely interpreted as a failure on the part of the United States to get an upper hand in eastern Syria and the Iraqi border areas. The Assad regime has now guaranteed access for Iraqi gas and oil to the Mediterranean, which would enable Syrian transit activities to generate remarkable revenue. Also, given that Iraq was a chief market for Syrian goods before the civil war, the Assad regime's control over Iraqi borders would provide significant financial support to Damascus. What disturbs Washington is that Iranian-backed Shia militias will likely deploy more forces from Iraqi border areas in order to exert pressure on the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the YPG in Deir Ezzor and other hydrocarbon-rich areas.\n\nWashington faces a dilemma. If it supports the SDF as Shia militias allied with the Assad regime attack oil fields in Deir Ezzor, the ensuing escalation may demand a long-term commitment to eastern Syria, and therefore a potential proxy war with Iran. On the other hand, if American troops remain reluctant to defend the SDF's territory, negotiations with the Assad regime may not produce a satisfactory outcome for Washington.\n\nA major challenge for Washington is the fact that SDF forces are still an extension of the YPG—despite the Pentagon's longstanding efforts to increase the numbers of Arab fighters in SDF ranks—and Syrian Kurdish dominance in the Arab populated region is impractical. The Assad regime has already won over some Arab tribes by offering a share of oil revenues. Regarding governance in Raqqa after the defeat of IS, some US officials envision replication of the arrangements in Manbij where Kurdish and Arab leaders have settled local power sharing mechanisms. The Manbij model, however, is hard to implement in eastern Syria where tribal networks are stronger, territory is vast, and the economy is based on natural resources. Aware of these difficulties, some YPG leaders have stated that they will seek diplomatic negotiations with the Assad regime. In fact, the PYD recently brokered a deal with the regime for oil fields in the Rimelan region, handing over control of the production in return for 20 percent of the revenue share.\n\nUnder such circumstances, Washington's protection of Kurdish areas to exert influence is only feasible if the PYD accepts a significant retreat from Arab populated territories to Kurdish zones near Turkey's border. Even in that case, the PYD's autonomy will be precarious in the long run as Damascus has an upper hand in determining the economy of the Kurdish zones. Similar to Iraqi Kurdistan, PYD-controlled cantons—what Kurds call Rojava, or Western Kurdistan—are landlocked.

{"text": "CCP's huge space MMO Eve Online delivers yet another player-driven emergent story. In contrast to its galaxy-spanning battles and political manoeuvring, however, this is a tale of personal revenge, stewed at ice-cold temperatures over four years.\n\nSuper-size your gaming with the best MMOs on PC.\n\nThe tale comes courtesy of Eve player Darvo Thellere, whose Reddit username – FUiamDave – stands in challenge to all who cross him.\n\nThe latest such enemy goes by the name of kackpappe, who earned Darvo's ire back in 2013. Starting one of the most complex MMOs in gaming is a daunting prospect at the best of times – see how Phil and Jordan handled it on our YouTube channel – but kackpappe made the unsporting decision to torment Darvo back when he was taking his first knock-kneed steps into space.\n\nDrawn by the newb-support organisation Darvo founded, kackpappe embarked on a months-long campaign of harassment intended to ruin the game for him and his fellow beginners. It was then that Darvo vowed – most likely in blood, or via some kind of ancestral heirloom – to have his revenge. \"I don't know how or when,\" Darvo told his nemesis, \"but the day will come that I will find you and I will take all your stuff.\"\n\nYears later, and Darvo has become strong. He describes his focus on EVE's PvP, on duelling other players in low-security space \"not because of [kackpappe] but because I liked the thrill of the hunt.\" We imagine some kind of Rocky-esque montage could and should be made of this preparation.\n\nHis patience was rewarded earlier this week, when he saw kackpappe was looking for a new corporation to join. Having founded the mercenrary alliance Ish-Stars, Darvo hatched a fiendish plan to wreak his revenge, but, ever honourable, he cleared it with his corporation's members, because \"being that kind of asshats is usually not what we do.\"\n\nDonning a disguise (that is, changing his name), Darvo seduced kackpappe into joining his corporation. He even \"created political drama\" with his former CEO – who was in on the plan – to justify his quarry teleporting via a cynosural field, with all his assets, right into Darvo's trap.\n\nKackpappe was surrounded and immediately fired upon by a whole fleet of ships, which he had thought would be his new allies. Only when Darvo changed his name back to his original identity did kackpappe realise what was happening, his last words echoing through space like the cry of the damned: \"argh fuck, Darvo Thellere\".\n\nHere's the record of the kill.

{"text": "Wikileaks rides again! This time, with a release of some 20,000 purported internal emails from the heart of the Democratic party, right in time for this week's convention in Philadelphia. Just when we were worried that it couldn't possibly top the RNC, am I right?\n\nOkay, first off, conspiracy theories: A lot of people (including the Clinton campaign) seem to think this was the Russians working to undermine the Democrats and pave Donald Trump's gold-plated road to victory.\n\nI am not entirely convinced of this: My own personal conspiracy theory is that Wikileaks, headed by a noted misogynist and big fans of Milo Yiannopoulos, wanted to take a swing at Secretary Hillary Clinton for having the audacity to run for president while female, and this was a great way to do it. It's not a coincidence that these emails were released as part of the \"Hillary Leaks\" series, you know.\n\nThere's also a debate about whether hacking for freedom is really justified, and whether the release of such documents crosses a line. This is an especially big concern when we're talking about the release of personal emails and identifying information that could pose a security risk. Wikileaks doesn't obscure identifying data, so it's important to talk about this, and why it's a problem.\n\nI'm always hesitant to endorse the release of personal information in the name of striking some kind of brave blow for freedom, but the fact is that these documents are in the public interest, because they are revealing some ugly and important truths about the internal workings of the DNC.\n\nSo let's take a look at some top hits.\n\n1) Is Bernie Sanders a Jew or an atheist?\n\nWhile not mentioned by name in this little gem, it's pretty clear that Brad Marshall was referring to Sanders when he said this: \"Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist.\"\n\nThis is an election in which antisemitism has been pretty rampant, partly in thanks to Donald Trump and partly in thanks to the fact that some people had a big problem with a Jewish man running for president. Earlier this month, NPR covered Jewish reporters being harassed by antisemitic Trump supporters, highlighting how pervasive this is. So this comment was kind of a big deal — so much so that Marshall was forced to apologize for it.\n\n2) A bowl of racism?\n\nWe all remember Donald Trump's infamous \"taco bowl\" tweet. If not, here you go:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728297587418247168 Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! https://t.co/ufoTeQd8yA pic.twitter.com/k01Mc6CuDI — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016\n\nBut after that overt racism on the Republican side, there was a nice little shot of internal racism with an email in which Rebecca Christopher refers to \"taco bowl engagement.\" Now, if I was generous, I'd say she was riffing off the taco bowl controversy and referring to the outrage over the Trump tweet. But her comments are ambiguous enough that it...kinda sounds like she's referring to Latinx voters as \"taco bowls.\"\n\nUpdate: After this piece ran, the DNC contacted us with the following statement:\n\n\"The 'taco bowl' reference in the email was clearly part of a discussion about the DNC's video response to Donald Trump's tone-deaf Cinco de Mayo tweet, and should not be misconstrued as anything else. It is part of the DNC's job to hold Donald Trump accountable for his divisive campaign, and we will continue to do that from now until Election Day.\"\n\n3) \"He isn't going to be president\"\n\nThroughout Bernie Sanders' run, he and his followers accused the DNC of throwing up roadblocks at every turn. A lot of those were pretty obvious even to casual observers, as the DNC clearly had its support behind Secretary Clinton from the start — though to be fair, Secretary Clinton had decades of history as a Democrat, and Senator Sanders only just switched parties, clearly with the intent of facilitating a presidential bid, since it's very challenging to run as an independent.\n\nOne revelation that came up again and again in these emails, though, is that the DNC really worked against the Vermont senator, and viewed him extremely dismissively — which is one of the more newsworthy elements of these emails.\n\nIn May, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, using her private email, said: \"He isn't going to be president,\" reacting to a statement from Senator Sanders that he would block any attempt at reappointing her. Granted, by May this was quite obvious, but it still looks pretty tacky, and it's telling that she opted not to", "label": "real"}
{"text": "Biographies of Apollo 11 Astronauts Buzz Aldrin | Neil Armstrong | Michael Collins\n\nOther Apollo Astronauts\n\nBuzz Aldrin—Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (1930- ) was born in Montclair, New Jersey, on 20 January 1930. He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, entered the United States Air Force, and received pilot training in 1951. Aldrin flew sixty-six combat missions in F-86s in Korea, destroying two MIG-15 aircraft. Known to all as by his nickname, \"Buzz,\" Aldrin was also one of the most important figures in the accomplishment of Project Apollo in successfully landing an American on the Moon in 1960s. Aldrin became an astronaut during the selection of the third group by NASA in October 1963. On 11 November 1966 he orbited aboard the Gemini XII spacecraft, a 4-day 59-revolution flight that successfully ended the Gemini program. It proved to be a fortuitous selection, for during Project Gemini Aldrin became one of the key figures working on the problem of rendezvous of spacecraft in Earth or lunar orbit, and docking them together for spaceflight. Without these skills Apollo could not have been successfully completed. Aldin, with a Ph.D. in astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was ideally qualified for this work, and his intellectual inclinations ensured that he carried out these tasks with enthusiasm. Systematically and laboriously, Aldrin worked to develop procedures and tools necessary to accomplish space rendezvous and docking. He was also a central figure in devising the methods necessary to carry out extravehicular activities (EVA) of astronauts outside their vehicles. That, too, was critical to the successful accomplishment of Apollo. Aldrin was chosen as a member of the three-person Apollo 11 crew that landed on the Moon on 20 July 1969, fulfilling the mandate of President John F. Kennedy to send Americans to the Moon before the end of the decade. Aldrin was the second American to set foot on the lunar surface. He and Apollo 11 commander Neil A. Armstrong spent about twenty hours on the Moon before returning to the orbiting Apollo Command Module. The spacecraft and the lunar explorers returned to Earth on 24 July 1969. In 1971 Aldrin returned to the Air Force and retired a year later. He wrote two important books about his activities in the U.S. space program. In Return to Earth (1970), Aldrin recounted the flight of Apollo 11. In the more broadly constructed Men from Earth (1989), Aldrin discussed the entire space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. He has been an important analyst of the space program since the 1960s. He lives near Los Angeles, California.\n\n\nReturn to Top Neil Armstrong - Neil Alden Armstrong (1930-2012) was born on 5 August 1930 on his grandparents' farm near Wapakoneta, Ohio, to Stephen and Viola Armstrong. Because Armstrong's father was an auditor for the State of Ohio, Armstrong grew up in several communities, including Warren, Jefferson, Ravenna, St. Marys, and Upper Sandusky, before the family settled in Wapakoneta. Armstrong developed an interest in flying at only age two when his father took him to the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio. His interest intensified when he went for his first airplane ride in a Ford Tri-Motor, a \"Tin Goose,\" in Warren, Ohio, at age six. From that time on, he claimed an intense fascination with aviation. At age fifteen, Armstrong began taking flying lessons at an airport north of Wapakoneta, working at various jobs in town and at the airport to earn the money for lessons in an Aeronca Champion airplane. By age sixteen, he had his student pilot's license, before he even passed his automobile driver's test and received that license and before he graduated from Blume High School in Wapakoneta in 1947. Immediately after high school Armstrong received a scholarship from the U.S. Navy. He enrolled at Purdue University and began his studies of aeronautical engineering. In 1949, the Navy called him to active duty, where he became an aviator, and in 1950, he was sent to Korea. There he flew seventy-eight combat missions from the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Essex. After mustering out of the Navy in 1952, Armstrong joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). His first assignment was at the NACA's Lewis Reserch Center, near Cleveland, Ohio. Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (later NASA's Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio, and today the Glenn Research Center) in 1955. For the next seventeen years, he was an engineer, test pilot, astronaut, and administrator for the NACA and its successor agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In the mid-1950s Armstrong transferred to NASA's Flight Research Center, Edwards, California, where he became a research pilot NACA's High-Speed Flight Station", "label": "real"}

We're excited to see the realization of the work that's a result of the industry coming together around a set of common, open standards for container technology.\n\nWith the OCI v1.0 specifications, we have taken a major step toward establishing standards for container deployment. This helps communities and vendors to innovate, while still retaining compatibility between container implementations where it really matters.\n\nThe OCI formed in June 2015, so the fact that the group has been able to get to a 1.0 release for such an important set of specifications in a bit more than two years is quite impressive. From the beginning, Red Hat believed that this work would be crucial to the success of Linux containers, and we've been fortunate to have Vincent Batts and Mrunal Patel representing us as maintainers on the Image Specification and Runtime Specification, respectively.\n\nWhat's in the specifications?\n\nThe OCI currently offers two specifications, the Runtime Specification and the Image Specification. The goal is to provide specifications that allow a provider to implement a system to download a container image and run it simply.\n\nThe Image Specification defines the OCI Image (we usually refer to this as a container image), which enables creation of tools that build, move, and prep an image for a container runtime. Basically, as long as images follow this specification, it should enable anyone to build tools that will work with the images and have the resulting images be compatible with any compliant runtime. Users are able to consume compliant images, without having to worry whether they were built by one set of tools or another.\n\nThe Runtime Specification defines the configuration, execution environment, and lifecycle of the container. The goal here is to enable multiple runtimes to exist that are compatible with OCI compliant images, so any vendor or community can create a runtime (such as runC) that works predictably and reliably with OCI images. Thanks to this specification, users can have their choice of container runtime that may offer features above and beyond the specification, but rest easy that their containers will work as expected.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe OCI v1.0 release is a huge accomplishment, but work won't stop here. Post-1.0, the OCI technical community has plans to discuss new specifications or additional aspects that should be covered in the runtime and image specs. The OCI is also working on a certification program.\n\nOnce again, we'd like to congratulate the OCI on reaching this milestone and we look forward to working with the OCI on future releases and helping container adoption maintain its momentum.", "label": "real"}

{"text": "There are two major trends taking place that are shaping up as a recipe for disaster. On the one hand, we have massively indebted governments around the world desperate for tax revenues and, on the other, steadily growing multi-trillion underground economies whose main goal is to avoid paying them.\n\nAccording to a recent study, the amount of uncollected tax revenues in the U.S. is estimated around a whopping 500 billion dollars per year1—enough money to bailout most of Europe.\n\n\nAt 8 percent of GDP, the underground or shadow economy in the U.S. is much smaller percentage-wise than other nations like Greece (25 percent), Italy (27 percent), or Thailand (70 percent)2, yet, given our overall size, America's untaxed economy is larger than \"the official output of all but the upper crust of nations across the globe…bigger than the GDP of Turkey or Austria.\"3\n\nQuestion is: How long will the government allow this to last?\n\nWhen times are good and the economy vibrant, there is less incentive to crack down on tax-evasion; but now, unemployment is at all-time highs, income and property taxes have fallen dramatically, and the government is supporting an increasingly large and record number of people through a wide range of benefits.\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures\n\nIn an interview with Jim Puplava titled \"Never Underestimate the Desperation of a Broke(n) Government\", world renowned economist, Martin Armstrong, cites numerous examples of how the U.S. is following a well set historical pattern where, inevitably, the \"government is going to be much more aggressive to tax people, chase them down, and put them in prison.\"\n\nJust recently, noted author and blogger, Charles Hugh Smith, cited how California—a case-study for high taxes, regulation, and smothering bureaucracy—automatically seized funds out of a previous resident's bank account for not filing taxes in the year 2006—five years after he had long moved out of state. In response to this incident, Smith writes, \"What is entirely believable is that the state of California, desperate for revenue, is churning out dubious income tax claims stretching back years and collecting the money without due process.\"4\n\nIf true, and these types of aggressive acts are to become more common, it should be fairly obvious that they won't achieve the desired results. As taxes are raised, regulations and filing requirement made more stringent, more and more people will merely leave the system. Eventually, the government will have to think of a different way to collect.\n\nWe could change current tax laws and make it less burdensome but, when given a choice between simple or none, most people would rather choose none; and since many realize that by doing everything in cash their transactions are virtually untraceable, the risk of getting caught is quite tiny compared to the benefits of keeping much more of their income.\n\nThe only option left is to remove the very thing that fuels the underground economy in the first place.\n\nCash becomes illegal\n\nConsider Italy Intensifies Its All-Out War on Tax Evaders\n\nIn addition to banning cash transactions, [Italy] has included an ad campaign comparing tax evaders to parasites. There have been headline-grabbing raids on stores, hotels and restaurants in affluent Italian cities. For good measure, tax officials have also been stopping luxury cars and asking drivers to show their licenses, then using the information to pull their most recent tax returns.\n\nRecently, best-selling financial author and well-known investor, Doug Casey, offered his perspective on this issue by pointing out that \"governments hate cash for lots of reasons…it costs a couple of cents to print a piece of paper currency, and they have to be replaced quite often. As the US has destroyed the value of the dollar, they've had to take the copper out of pennies, and soon they'll take the nickel out of nickels. Furthermore, with modern technology, counterfeiters—including unfriendly foreign governments—can turn out US currency that's almost indistinguishable from the real thing. And the stuff takes up a lot of space if it's enough to be of value. So sure, governments would like to get rid of tangible currency. They'd like to see all money kept in banks.\"5\n\nItaly or Sweden?\n\nAside from how governments personally feel about cash, some societies are choosing to abandon it voluntarily. As recently reported by the Associated Press, cash only represents 3% of Sweden's entire economy—a trend that isn't being enforced through law but rather embraced by a strongly technological and innovation-loving people.6 No \"headline-grabbing raids\", automatic seizure of bank funds, or stopping luxury car owners to check their most recent tax returns. Then again, Sweden is also known for having the highest tax rates in the world.\n\nAlthough the total amount of money changing hands in America's shadow economy", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Excerpted from David De Ugarte in Five argumentative fallacies and one methodological fallacy without which degrowth cannot stand:\n\n\"The degrowth arguments form a unique fabric of classic, yet socially widespread, fallacies. Together, they form an argumentative fabric as false as it is seductive, which is able to generate the illusion of rationality, propped up on our own vices and intellectual laziness. However, it's worth making the effort and coming back around to the perspective of abundance: while capitalism is driving us towards a cliff, degrowth leads us to think like lemmings.\n\nIn our debates with catastrophists and degrowthers, five argumentative fallacies and one methodological fallacy appear which are self-reinforcing and form a fabric that is difficult to unravel. In an arena like this, getting into the numbers debate is playing with marked cards in a game whose result is predetermined.\n\nThe methodological fallacy is obviously the Ricardian fallacy: accepting that there is predictive value in the results of a forecast made by projecting a single variable and \"freezing\" all other social factors that influence the studied process.\n\n\"If technology remains as it is and the rate of discoveries stays the same, petroleum reserves will run out at such-and-such a time and a sudden lack shortage of energy resources will produce an unprecedented crisis of civilization,\" peak-oilers tell us… and they've had to correct the date on a half-dozen occasions in 10 years. The last announced date was 2010… and that was corrected, too. Technology evolves at an accelerated rate, and reserves are an economic variable, not a natural one. Economic variables are the result of other variables, and cannot be \"frozen\" without putting any prediction in doubt.\n\nA similar thing happened to the famous demographer Paul Elrich, updater of Malthusianism. In his book Population Bomb (1970), he predicted a global demographic crisis by the end of the Seventies and the beginning ofthe Eighties with mass starvation in South America, Asia, and Africa. The result, despite the increase in population, was very different.\n\nThe Ricardian fallacy \"works,\" which is to say, we tend to let it slide, because it responds to the need for control and simplification in the 19th-century scientific narrative we were taught. But the fact is, it dramatically reduces the applicability of its own conclusions: it only shows \"what would happen if.\" And we shouldn't forget that from the very moment we asked the question, we knew the conditions we put on it wouldn't be met.\"\n\nContinue reading the full essay here.", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Undrafted free agent wide receiver Jake Kumerow has made an impression on his new team thus far in camp. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar)\n\nEvery day after practice, Jake Kumerow moves over to a side field, stands yards away from the JUGS machine, and has it fire football after football into his hands.\n\nWith no helmet and standing still, Kumerow would whip his head, shoulders and hands up to catch balls that could reach 70 miles per hour.\n\nIt's a simple drill, fairly unspectacular.\n\nBut it's one of the main reasons why an undrafted free agent wide receiver out of Division III University of Wisconsin-Whitewater not only is in camp for the Cincinnati Bengals, but also impressing the front office, coaches and veteran teammates.\n\nGood habits breed success.\n\n\"Now that I'm here doing it, it's really necessary because if you don't get your head around quick, that ball is coming in hot,\" Kumerow said. \"And if you're running a slant and you don't snap your head around, you run an out route and you don't snap your head around fast, you're late to the ball. Your eyes are late, then your hands are late.\"\n\nBloodlines are bloodlines and Kumerow was, most likely, going to benefit physically from the fact that his father Eric was a 6-foot-7, 264-pound NFL linebacker.\n\nBut the art of catching a football goes beyond genetics. It's work, work that began with Paul Petrino when Kumerow walked on at the University of Illinois.\n\nPetrino had been the Atlanta Falcons receivers coach in 2007 and held that same position at Arkansas from 2008-09 before he joined Kumerow in Champaign, Illinois in 2010. The walk-on redshirted his freshman year, and Petrino drilled, and drilled, and drilled.\n\n\"He just learned how to do all the little things and paid attention to the details,\" said Petrino, who is now the head coach at the University of Idaho. \"His toughness is what started it and he had good hands. He was very coachable and he got better as each week went on.\"\n\nQuick shoulders. Quick head. Quick hands.\n\nAfter all, one yard of separation is open in the NFL.\n\n\"It's definitely something that you need to do to be a good receiver and being here, in this league, even through OTAs, I found that it really, really matters,\" Kumerow said.\n\nKumerow played under head coach Ron Zook and Petrino in 2010 and for part of 2011, when Zook was fired midway through the season. After one season with new Illinois coach Tim Beckman in 2012 in which he led the Illini in yards per reception and finished fourth in scoring with three touchdowns, Kumerow decided to transfer in 2013. He moved down two levels so he could play immediately and earn a bigger role for a perennial national championship contender in UW-Whitewater in Whitewater, Wisconsin.\n\nHe brought the work ethic with him – even if practicing like an NFL receiver meant he was always slightly ahead of Division III defensive backs and quarterbacks.\n\n\"Technically, he was so natural with the position, with his hands, with understanding the leverage on corners and on DBs, he could get off press, he just had a lot of natural abilities that really separated him from a lot of the competition he was going against,\" said former UW-Whitewater receivers coach Alan Hensell, who is now the tight ends coach for the University of Buffalo.\n\n\"He's tremendous on what we call 'stick and route' – he could stick that outside foot and come out and snap his head around and his hands would be right there. It was a thing he was really good at.\"\n\nFollowing a 2014 campaign in which UW-Whitewater won the second of back-to-back national titles and Kumerow was named the Division III offensive player of the year in 2014, Bengals scout Bill Tobin stumped for the wide receiver as the team began to compile its list of targets in the post-draft free agent market.\n\nKumerow had a draft grade in the Bengals war room, but there were questions.\n\nWould he be overwhelmed by an NFL locker room? What is his work ethic like? Will he play special teams? Is he fast enough? How will he do against an NFL Pro Bowl corner?\n\nHensell heard these questions first hand as the UW-Whitewater liaison for NFL scouts and was tasked with answering for his playmaker.\n\n\"He's not going to flinch,\" Hensell told scouts. \"He's going to live up to the challenge. I don't see him being intimidated at all by that situation.\"\n\nThis is where the bloodlines do matter. Kumerow grew up around the", "label": "real"}

Output growth has picked up again, and export order books match the highest in more than 20 years.\n\n\"Nonetheless, uncertainty continues to hold back investment and cost pressures remain strong.

I am a handyman that does EVERYTHING, including build cabinets and such. I had been using a stapler/pinner combo gun that I was never really happy with. I could never find a nail gun or pinner that I was happy with the quality/price with, so I kept holding out. I stumbled onto this pack and was very excited. We cracked open the box and everything seemed very solid and well put together. Even my dad, who has been using Porter Cable guns for the last 15 years, was very pleased and couldn't believe the quality and handling of these guns for this price. I highly recommend them for someone who uses various guns on a semi regular basis.\n\nRated 1 out of 5 by ToEachHisOwn from Garbage! Short Life! They Don't Last. I bought this set to replace a finishing nail that failed after 15 years. This set the finishing nailer didn't even make it though the box of nails that came with the guns. After taking the gun nose apart to get a jammed nail out I discovered why they won't last. The driving pin doesn't appear to be hardened steel. Just look at the attached picture. I returned to HomeDepot and bought the Ridgid finishing nailer, a much better product that is designed to last! My advise is don't waste your money on this set. They won't last.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by JimL from Best deal out there I bought this set of nail guns mainly for the 16 gauge finish nailer. When I saw the price, I thought they must be of poor quality but there were too many good reviews to ignore. I needed them for a crown molding project and they really made the job a lot easier. I used the 16 gauge finish nailer to put up backer board and then used the 18 brad nailer for the crown. Both of them loaded easily and never jammed. I was able to use the nails that came with the set to complete the job of over 120' of 3.5\" crown. My compressor would kick on every 30 min or so when not using the nailer due to air leakage, possible a slow, inaudible leak in the gun or in the hose connections. With the hose disconnected, there was no leakage. The set was delivered in a couple of days, in good condition. I did have a few misfires until I learned how hard to press against the work, then they fired every time. Once I got the air pressure right, every nail was countersunk about 1/16\", (perfect). Order these and you shouldn't be disappointed. If I were a professional installer I would have gone with a more expensive brand name, but for my purposes, these were great!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by HappyWithPurchase from A good value for the price I am a weekend warrior at best, but I really wanted my own air nailers. After looking nearly everywhere both on line and in stores I eventually settled on this combo set. It was the reviews that convinced me to give this set a try and I must say they were accurate. I've used all four nailers and I am completely satisfied with them all. The build quality, feel in your hand, the ease of use, etc are all acceptable to me. I agree that these are not pro level quality, but they are excellent for my needs. If you are looking for a bargain, give these a try.\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by Paunao from Very happy with product I bought this 4-piece nailing kit and have used them extensively as I am finishing out my basement. In one month, I have used them a lot, and I have been very happy with all of them. Occasionally a nail will get hung up in the 18-guage nailer, but I'm not surprised by that. It's pretty easy to get the nail out, although you have to remove a few parts to do it. Since the whole set comes for $100, I highly recommend it. I've been very pleased with it so far, and expect I will continue to be.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mike from These nailers can't be beat for the week end handy-man The value here for the homeowner handy-man can't be beat. I purchased these four nailers for an unbeatable price and for that price the quality of the nailers is surprising! The only thing I would change would be to add a rubber cushion on the end of the 18gage nailer.

{"text": "TRIGGER WARNING: Discussion of sexual assault\n\nBy now, most people will have read, or at least heard of, the Rolling Stone article that details the alleged gang rape of Jackie, a first-year student at the University of Virginia (UVA). The day I read her story, my reaction was similar to that of my female friends: sadness, anger, empathy, but not surprise. When I heard that Jackie's story was being questioned, though, my reaction was slightly different from that of my peers: My first thought was, \"So what?\"\n\nSo what if there are inaccuracies in this individual's story? The journalist side of me tells me that the devil is in the details, but a larger part of me knows that the real devil is the rape culture that pervades college campuses. The national obsession with proving or disproving Jackie's story only serves to obscure this point.\n\nTo me, and to many other college women, it doesn't matter if Jackie's story is discrepant in some areas. What matters is that while we nitpick every detail of her account, campus rape continues to make survivors out of thousands of women every year. What matters is that I have lost count of the number of friends who have been assaulted in my three-and-a-half years on campus. What matters is the pain, the feelings of shame and the fact that the survivors I know are just a fraction of the one in five college women who will be sexually assaulted by the time they graduate.\n\nNo matter the outcome of Jackie's case, nothing will change how her story rang true for too many college women. I know it rang true for me.\n\nIt was only after reading Jackie's story, and hearing the outpouring of support from other survivors, that I was finally able to tell my friends what happened to me my freshman year at Occidental College. It was after our first big campus dance that I was introduced to the underbelly of campus hookup culture. Wandering the dance floor, drunk and separated from my friends, I ran into an upperclassman who invited me back to his dorm for an after-party. The \"party,\" it turned out, was the two of us alone in his bedroom. Despite the fact that I was unable to walk on my own, and repeatedly told him not to remove his clothes, he carried me to his bed and undressed us both. Fifteen minutes later, when I left his room in tears, he told me that what happened was my fault—that I was \"too beautiful to resist.\" I never filed a formal complaint, because it wasn't until I began reporting on sexual assault in my sophomore year that I even named what had happened to me as rape.\n\nWhen I told this story to my friends recently, the men looked at me in disbelief. But the women nodded their heads in agreement, as every one of them had experienced something similar.\n\nOne of my sorority sisters was also assaulted her freshman year and, unlike me, attempted to report the assault to our school. Instead of finding support, she was repeatedly rebuffed by administrators, driving her into a spiral of depression, self-loathing and anorexia that required a semester-long leave to recover from. Last year, a coworker from my campus job left school and moved across the country. It was later revealed that she had been assaulted by another of our coworkers and was afraid to return to campus.\n\nThis is the reality of being a woman in college: Interspersed with the popular tales of wild parties and consensual hookups are whispered stories of aggression, coercion and rape. But don't take my word for it: Look up the pages upon pages of similar stories that women shared in the wake of the Rolling Stone piece. Instead of focusing on Jackie's case, let's focus on the larger culture that exists—at UVA, at Occidental, at others schools across the country—that makes women feel unsafe on their own campuses.\n\nOne questionable account does not change the fact that the problem with rape cases isn't false reporting; it's underreporting. False reports make up only 2 to 8 percent of all rape reports, while less than 5 percent of college sexual-assault survivors report their rapes at all. Yet our first reaction to any account of rape is to immediately question its validity, just as the media has done to Jackie's account in the last few weeks. We become consumed with nit-picking every detail of the story, even though we know that trauma can make victims' memories fuzzy and that many rapes aren't reported until years after the fact.\n\nOur tendency to distrust accounts of rape not only re-traumatizes the survivors but contributes to a culture that allows serial rapists to go free.

{"text": "America's most charming radio program recently had a wonderful coffee-forward segment by way of Third Wave Toast. When reporter John Gravois set out to cover San Francisco's latest toast trend it lead him to the reluctant architect of the movement – Giulietta Carrelli. Carrelli owns Trouble Coffee and Coconut Club, an unassuming coffee bar located at in the Outer Sunset with an outpost in Hunters Point.\n\nThe segment is adapted from an earlier work – Gravois wrote \"A Toast Story\" for Pacific Standard back in January.\n\nAt Trouble, you can order a \"Build Your Own Damn House\", which is a combination of French roast coffee, a young coconut, and a thick slice of cinnamon toast. It's a magical thing. Gravois wrote about it for his feature (emphasis ours):\n\n[Carrelli] called the shop Trouble, she says, in honor of all the people who helped her when she was in trouble. She called her drip coffee \"guts\" and her espresso \"honor.\" She put coconuts on the menu because of the years she had spent relying on them for easy sustenance, and because they truly did help her strike up conversations with strangers. She put toast on the menu because it reminded her of home: \"I had lived so long with no comfort,\" she says. And she put \"Build Your Own Damn House\" on the menu because she felt, with Trouble, that she had finally done so.\n\nThe story was picked up for an piece in National Public Radio's This American Life program. The episode, No Place Like Home, covers stories about where individuals define where they're from. It includes fake border crossings, telemarketers with American accents, and Trouble.\n\nThe coffee-focused segment is seventeen minutes and available below:\n\nListen to the full episode here.\n\nThe original Trouble Coconut Club is located at 4033 South Judah in San Francisco's Outer Sunset neighborhood, with hours from 7am until 7pm daily. Trouble's second location is at 1370 Yosemite Avenue in San Francisco's Hunters Point neighborhood, with hours ibid.", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Angara is a fully Russian LV, Zenit is more complicated. The rocket is made in Ukraine, but the engine and some components (and third stage) are Russian. And there are two Launchers, Sea Launch, which is 95% owned by Energia, and Land Launch, which is a subsidiary of Sea Launch, but launches from the Baikonour, wich is Kasthastistan. And the Russian government also buys Zenit directly for their military payloads. So is sort of a complicated situation.\n\nThe rough translation of the article, said that the issue at hand was the RD-180 contract with PWR. As has been said before, it might be part of a new price haggling by Energomash due to:\n\n1) Knowing that the Atlas is the workhorse of ULA.\n\n2) The current dismantling of the Shuttle might increase significantly the cost of the RS-68A.\n\n3) The fact that inflation has been high in USA.\n\n4) The huge devaluation of the dollar might have affected seriously the price (in dollars) of the engine.\n\n5) The costs of starting up the production and the ongoing costs are sort of know to all the parties.\n\nMy take is that Energomash will try to keep the price between a 10% of the US cost. This way PWR would save the start up costs, and get a better price by buying Russian. But they will include some changes to better take into account the parity differential of the ruble to the dollar. When the original contract where made, nobody was worried of the devaluation of the dollar to the ruble. So most probably everything was set to dollars since it made sense to PWR to keep their costs in their own accounting money, and the Russians never expected to have a stronger ruble than the dollar. A decade later this has happened, so the Russian will want to protect themselves from that.\n\nI still think it has a lot to do with accounting and fiscal standards. I hate paying income takes, and I guess everybody does. If they got a lot of money upfront, they closed their pricing, and got the money out of NPO Energomash to the parent company through a \"loan\" or \"advance for future profits\", from a purely fiscal accounting perspective, they might have then posted a loss from the natural increase of cost by means of inflation. This happens a lot with long term international contracts.\n\nThere's also the possibility, that the Russians did set a fixed price in dollars, and then failed to take the necessary financial protection towards a significant change of exchange rates.\n\nComing from a communist economy, this might have happen due to three causes: they decided to speculate that the ruble would depreciate to the dollar, their market lacked the necessary instruments for a ten year protection with some unknowns on the quantities, or they simply lacked the necessary financial market knowledge to prevent this. I just have a couple of friends who worked in Russia and told me they where very similar to my country in the sophistication of the financial market.\n\nIn fact, it's not clear the financial instruments where even available a decade ago.", "label": "real"}
{"text": "Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter\n\nWhen your elementary school-aged son gets in trouble for acting up in class or playing too rough with another student, you might not be surprised if the teacher keeps him in from recess. But what if acting up was hurting his math grade?\n\n\nIt's a topic of concern to some moms who worry that their sons' \"boys-will-be-boys\" sensibilities make them less successful in a rigid, traditional classroom setting. Now a new study finds that boys in elementary school earned lower grades than they would have based on test scores, mostly because their teachers held their classroom behavior against them.\n\n\"Boys get lower grades than what their test scores would suggest and girls get higher grades than what their test scores would suggest,\" said Jessica Van Parys, a co-author of the study published this month in The Journal of Human Resources and doctoral economics student at Columbia University.\n\n\"It shows that the gender differences in education emerge very early and it points to one potential explanation for why girls are outperforming boys in years of schooling and academic achievement,\" Van Parys said. \"It's a piece to a very big puzzle.\"\n\n\nDoes a boy's classroom behavior affect what grades a teacher gives him? A new study says it just might. Jamie Grill / Today\n\nThe findings don't surprise Stacey Sypko, a 48-year-old stay-at-home mom from New York, who wonders if her 8-year-old son's \"wiggle worm\" behavior may be impacting his grades.\n\n\n\"He's very social,\" she said of her oldest, now in third grade. \"He can't sit long without having to lean over to a friend. He's very chatty and wants to have a good time. We've been hearing about that since he was in pre-K.\"\n\nDoes the new study concern Sypko?\n\n\"It does worry me,\" she said. \"I know some of his teachers have less patience for his behavior. He'll be graded lower in their classes than in his home room. Maybe because they have him for less time than the other teachers, so they're more aware of the kids that are disrupting everything.\"\n\nAccording to the study, disruptive behavior may indeed be working against the wiggle worms of the world.\n\nVan Parys and co-researchers analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics involving about 6,000 mostly white, black and Hispanic students from around the country who were followed from kindergarten through fifth grade, starting in the 1998-1999 school year.\n\nStudents were given tests in reading, math and science, while teachers also rated students' abilities in all three areas, as well as rated them on classroom behaviors. The study found that when assessing kids' academic abilities, the teachers factored in their classroom behaviors.\n\nThis ultimately helped the girls and hurt boys. The girls scored about 15 percent higher in behavior (also called \"non-cognitive skills\"), which meant they earned better grades than boys, even though they didn't score as high on the tests.\n\n\"Our point is that teachers take into account other factors, either consciously or unconsciously, when they rate the child's ability on all kinds of subject areas,\" Van Parys said. \"It's hard for teachers to be completely objective when they're giving an assessment.\"\n\nSome education experts say that such a bias against boys is possible because of such long-held stereotypes that \"boys will be boys\" - fidgety, unfocused and unruly at school - while girls should sit quietly, pay attention and act ladylike.\n\n\"It is possible and also likely, given that teachers enter schools and classrooms with particular expectations and gender stereotypes, that they very likely play themselves out in evaluating student work and discipline and the ways a teacher interacts with students,\" said Shaun Harper, an associate professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania and expert in gender and education.\n\nHe recommended improved training for future and current teachers that allows them \"to reflect deeply on the stereotypes and the ways they've been socialized to think about gender.\"\n\nThe study, he said, \"calls attention for the need for deeper conversations, more conscious-raising among teachers, parents and others about the stereotypes and gender expectations that follow girls and boys through all levels of schools.\"\n\nLisa Fiore, dean of faculty at Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass., agreed that teachers could potentially be biased against boys, but also said standardized tests have inherent biases that could be unfair to kids who lacked expected behaviors.\n\n\"My instinct is to say that maybe the test isn't accurate,\" she said. \"Test scores are a lovely example of children's knowledge and skills but they're absolutely not the end-all, be-all. For me, a grade students would receive would take into account more than a single test score. ... I'm wondering if a teacher's grade is more accurate", "label": "real"}
{"text": "The Ikea monkey will not be returned to its owner, Yasmin Nakhuda, and will remain in an animal sanctuary following an Ontario judge's ruling.\n\nThe Japanese snow macaque named Darwin became an internet sensation after he was filmed and photographed running loose in the parking lot of an Ikea store in north Toronto in December.\n\nThe animal had escaped from a car parked in the lot wearing a stylish shearling coat and diapers.\n\nToronto animal services seized the monkey and sent him to the Story Book Primate Sanctuary in Sunderland, Ont., 100 kilometres northeast of Toronto, setting off a legal battle with Nakhuda and the sanctuary over custody of Darwin.\n\nYasmin Nakhuda waged an unsuccessful court fight to regain custody of Darwin, arguing that animal services staff tricked her into surrendering custody of the Japanese macaque. (Chris Young/Canadian Press)\n\nNakhuda filed a civil suit against the sanctuary, which was dismissed by Friday's decision.\n\nJustice Mary Vallee ruled the monkey is a wild animal and not a domestic pet. This was a key legal point in the case, as the law deems the owner of a wild animal as the party that possesses it.\n\nShe cited a 96-year-old court ruling that when a wild animal kept as a pet runs away, the owner loses the right to it.\n\n\"It wasn't a child custody dispute,\" said Kevin Toyne, the lawyer for the sanctuary, \"and animals are property, so it was the law of property that governed.\"\n\nThe judge rejected Nakhuda's argument that Toronto animal services staff duped her and acted illegally by seizing Darwin.\n\n\"Concerns about illegally imported monkey disease were good reasons to detain the monkey,\" Vallee said in her ruling.\n\nIn her ruling, which is posted at the bottom of this story, the judge also said Nakhuda purchased Darwin for $5,000 from an exotic animal dealer, knowing that it was illegal.\n\nShe also lied by telling the media the animal was a gift, the judge wrote in her ruling.\n\nA Toronto bylaw prohibits the ownership of exotic pets, and Nakhuda was fined $250 when Darwin was seized.\n\n\"Ms. Nakhuda maintaining that the monkey was a gift shows that she was prepared to embellish the facts to improve her legal position,\" the judge wrote. \"This undermines her credibility.\"\n\nA lawyer for Story Brook owner Sherri Delaney said that Darwin will stay, at least for now, at the sanctuary, where he is interacting with other primates and receiving high-quality veterinary care.\n\nNakhuda's lawyer's office said she would not be commenting on the decision Friday.\n\nHow Nakhuda got the monkey\n\nThe judge's decision also reveals the circumstances of how Nakhuda, a real estate lawyer, came to own Darwin.\n\nShe approached an exotic pets dealer, named in the judge's decision only by his first name Ayaz, expressing interest in owning a monkey. He offered the macaque to her on a trial basis for free. Nakhuda soon had trouble controlling Darwin, who was prone to biting and screaming and would thrash around wildly when his diaper was changed.\n\nIn a bid to help, Ayaz came to Nakhuda's house and \"taught Ms. Nakhuda to have a very firm hand with the monkey,\" according to the judge's decision.\n\n\"He grabbed the monkey hard by the throat and hit him in the side of the head. After this the monkey complied with having his diaper changed. Ms. Nakhuda was not comfortable with using this amount of physical force on the monkey.\"\n\nNakhuda tried to return Darwin to the dealer, but when the animal clung to her, she changed her mind, feeling an obligation to keep him, and paid the dealer $5,000.\n\n\"Ms. Nakhuda requested a receipt but Ayaz told her that he doesn't provide receipts or papers,\" the judge's decision reads. \"Ms. Nakhuda understood she had purchased an 'illegal' animal.\"\n\nWhen the story of Darwin's escape at Ikea broke in December, Nakhuda went to Ayaz for help in retrieving the monkey. Citing the intense media attention, he refused and advised her to walk away, promising to refund the $5,000.\n\n\"[Ayaz] said that he could not get involved in the matter, because he did not want any media attention,\" reads the judge's ruling. \"A serious argument followed. Ayaz told Nakhuda that the best thing to do would be to forget about the monkey and walk away. He would refund the $5,000.\"", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Pin 1 4K Shares\n\nJosh Paniagua\n\nMay 25, 2015\n\n(ANTIMEDIA) El Dorado County sheriff's Deputy Mark Zlendick was arrested last Tuesday in Douglas County, Nevada on drug-related charges.\n\nAuthorities responded to a call involving a domestic dispute on the 1300 block of Centerville Ln. Once arriving, police detained Zlendick and an unidentified woman. Zlendick was eventually arrested and after conducting an investigation of the scene, officers discovered narcotics — including crystal methamphetamine — and drug paraphernalia.\n\nZlendick, an officer of 11 years, was taken in and booked at Douglas County jail for trafficking methamphetamine, suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, conspiracy, and possession of paraphernalia. His bail was set at $55,640. Zlendick posted bail and he is now on paid administrative leave for the duration of the investigation.\n\nWhat should be particularly noted about this case is Deputy Zlendick is not only a police officer, but he is assigned to the South Lake Tahoe Narcotics Enforcement Team, otherwise known as SLEDNET. In other words, he works for the same people that raid medical marijuana dispensaries, raid grow operations, red-flag houses for investigation, while at the same time allegedely trafficking in meth.\n\nIn fact, Anti-Media obtained an exclusive interview with a victim of Zlendick and SLEDNET's thug-like tactics and behavior. Going only by the internet alias \"Dyrti Al\" (we'll refer to him as Al), our source walked us through his unsettling experience.\n\nAl was working at a tattoo parlor owned by a man named Gino Dimatteo who also happened to own a medical marijuana dispensary in Tahoe. Police had discovered that Dimatteo had been selling more product from his shop than on record, to which they responded with attempts at extortion. After Dimatteo refused to be extorted, the harassment began.\n\n\"Around the time they were building a case against him, they went around and raided everyone's house who had anything to do with him,\" Al says.\n\nAl was one of the people who had their house raided.\n\n\"They obviously didn't have enough on me to get a warrant, so they came and asked if they could look around my house. I said no, and they told me they were going to get a warrant […] knowing they couldn't get one, one of the sharper fellas in their lynch mob made a deal with me. They were looking for a safe and large amounts of pot. If they didn't find either, they wouldn't charge me with anything they found in the house,\" Al tells Anti-Media.\n\nHe eventually agreed to their terms. Al had been operating a very small and miniscule grow operation in one part of his house. So small in fact that the officers that discovered it allegedly laughed at it. But incarceration wasn't the only thing worrying Al during the raid.\n\n\"I was literally shaking from all the commotion and there were reports recent at the time where SLEDNET was pretty much shooting every dog in every raid they conducted,\" Al says. \"I expresed my concerns about this and the cop who got arrested for selling meth [Zlendick] told me 'If we wanted to shoot your dog, we already would have'.\"\n\nAl also suggests that Zlendick might have been high during the raid, adding: \"Figured his pupils were dilated from the thrill of their shitkicking, but it appears now that it may have been chemically induced.\"\n\nThe police haggled with Al for some time, threatening him with federal prison time for involvement with Dimatteo (a claim which was completely dry of evidence), jail time for his tiny grow operation in the back room, and threatening to return with a real warrant and tear his home apart if he did not leak information (that he did not have).\n\n\"One of the cops was petting my dog while he was saying all this to me, implying it would be in my best interest to play ball with them, etc.\" Al says.\n\nThe harassment from police didn't stop at the raid. SLEDNET officers subsequently pursued, what I like to call, a stalking campaign to further intimidate and harass Al.\n\n\"They called me at work, made me call them back, came in and questioned random clients I was tattooing at the shop who were even more clueless than I was about what was happening. I don't believe these officers to be actual retarded people. They weren't conducting terrible investigatory police work that made no sense, they were making a point that Gino should leave town with no regard to how it was fucking my life up and involving people who were just going about their day.\"\n\nAl left Tahoe soon after in order to avoid any further conflict or confrontation with SL", "label": "real"}

{"text": "The jump from 2D to 3D isn't just big—it's trans-dimensional! 3D can be daunting, but let's try to ease the painful transition with a solid game plan for getting your game ideas into a 3D space. We're not covering the specifics of creating 3D objects here, but we will be discussing tips for putting these into a game scene and getting the most out of them visually and in play.\n\nRelated Posts 3D Primer for Game Developers: An Overview of 3D Modeling in Games\n\nWhat Is a 3D Environment?\n\nEasy, right? They're just places! Games are deceptively simple organisms, though. Those that take the most care with their environment create non-intrusive tangibility: a place where the player doesn't feel that they're surrounded by artificial geometric shapes doctored up to give the illusion of a living world to play in. Tricking the user into thinking they're trapped in a desolate space station or deep in the ocean's depths, when they're actually in a comfy computer chair, takes careful planning, iterative execution, and a lot of trial and error.\n\nWhen starting your first scenes, an initial thought may be, \"I'm going to put trees here\", followed by creating forests every which way and running into all kinds of problems down the line. We should start following up the urge to place assets with questions like, \"How will the collision fit around this naturally?\", \"Can the view of the player be obstructed if they run behind a given object\", and ultimately, \"Do these new environments assets actually make the level look and play better?\".\n\nThere are a lot of preconceived notions about what a game environment is, and, to be fair, there are many general practices in this area when it comes to making a game, whether it's an FPS with lots of box collision and corridors, a side scroller with generic platforms of given sizes, or an open space environment with nothing but asteroids to fill in the background. What your game environment is composed of is up to you (and the team you're working with), and how much content you need to populate that environment will depend on the type of game you plan to create.\n\nIn this article I'll be referencing our indie game, tentatively titled Flap Jack, to help us cover some of the universal concepts of environment art. This project is \"2.5D\", meaning that the art is fully 3D, but the gameplay takes place on a 2D plane.\n\nStep One: Don't Panic\n\nWhile piecing together one of your first 3D scenes, the last thing you want to do is bog yourself down worrying over technical restraints; you'll have enough on your mind getting things working on a basic level.\n\nPolygons look pointy, but they're harmless.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of creating a 3D environment is having strict restrictions on texture sizes, polygon limits, draw calls, and tons of other technical garble we're not going to discuss in this tutorial. So, before we move forward, take a deep breath (and take those worries off your mind). We're concerned with making things functional, we want to make things look nice. Worry about finishing a scene, not optimizing it. There will be plenty of time to develop the best practices for optimizing performance when the basics become a no-brainer.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's actually start making stuff!\n\nFinding Reference Material and Planning Your Scene\n\nOkay, I lied, we're not ready to make stuff yet—but this part of the project is fun, educational, and motivating, so no complaints! Finding reference material is the process of amassing images that you can draw inspiration from and that will aid in the creation of your scene without hindering it. These images can further be used as color palettes to help you pick lighting, fog, sky, and texture colors.\n\nBetween these two images, think about which might be a good reference image for someone new to creating 3D environments:\n\n\nTop: Limbo by Danish developer Playdead. Bottom: Avatar\n\nIf you chose Limbo, good on you! With its muted colors and minimal background elements, this is a great stylistic choice to get your foot in the door creating 3D environments, and, best of all, it has artistic value and atmosphere despite being relatively simple!\n\nIf you want to capture the grandeur of a multi million dollar movie production with no runtime restrictions, you probably want to reconsider your artistic direction; it's important to have realistic expectations for your first forays into the 3D space or you're going to get frustrated.\n\n\"But Limbo isn't 3D\", you may be thinking. Reference images aren't necessarily meant to be directly copied—in fact, they shouldn't be. You're drawing inspiration here to make your game or scene, not someone else's. Some 3", "label": "real"}
{"text": "Aphex Twin - Cheetah EP\n\nOf course Richard D. James would put together a record of sub-120 BPM tracks and call it. But in fact, the title is a reference to a rare, discontinued digital synth from the early '90s. The English brand's MS800 model was apparently so difficult to program and had such undesirable sounds that some gear-heads have called it \"a contender for one of the worst [synths] ever.\" One sound designer who actually worked on the product in the late '80s described the machine's inner-workings as \"bizarre.\" Then again, others have said , \"There's nothing else quite like it for low-fi digital weirdness on the ultra cheap...one for the adventurous/experimental/patient/mad.\" So it's easy to see why the Cheetah appealed to James, an artist who's difficult, bizarre and quite like nothing else.These seven tracks are less about retaining the Cheetah's knotty qualities than taming them. The music's practiced restraint makes for some of the most delightfully unexpected Aphex Twin tracks since the release of Caustic Window . That's at least partially down to the mellow tempos and the sparse, dulcet arrangements, which give the glowing \"CHEETAHT7b\" and the nimble \"CIRKLON 1\" a laconic grace. It's almost as if James took a cue from Aaron Funk's idea of soporific acid and worked it into existing sequences. The EP sounds born of the sessions that comprised Syro , but this is the sedate yin to that record's frenetic yang. \"CIRKLON3 [ Колхозная mix ]\" reimagines the fantastic clusterfuck that is \"CIRCLONT6A [141.98][syrobonkus mix]\" as an impish playmate, and \"CHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum]\" translates the slo-mo swagger of \"produk 29 [101]\" into sleepwalking techno. James can be just as magnetic when half drugged and barely awake.Ifis lacking in anything it's variety—when James decided to restrain himself he took no half measures. (Highlight \"2X202-ST5\" is little more than a drum machine, one hell of a bassline and one eight-note synth melody.) Compared to recent short-form records like the Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 EP and AFX's Orphaned Deejay Selek (2006-2008) , the record hews especially close to a strain of plush acid, albeit with Aphex Twin's inimitable charm. But a short change of pace arrives from the dissonant \"CHEETA1b ms800\" and \"CHEETA2 ms800,\" which seem to be brief tests of rich, textured patches from the Cheetah. These tracks complete a record that finds inspiration and style from obstacles and restrictions.", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Editor's Note: After this story was broadcast, one of the winemakers named in the lawsuit gave a statement to CBS News, which can be found at the bottom of this article.\n\nFollowing recent warnings about the amount of arsenic in apple juice and rice, a proposed class action lawsuit is being filed Thursday in California that claims some of the country's top selling wines have high levels of the element: up to four and five times the maximum amount the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows for drinking water, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.\n\nThere are almost no federal labeling requirements to tell you what's really in wine, that's why a Denver laboratory started running tests to find out.\n\nAfter 15 years working in the wine distribution business, Kevin Hicks started BeverageGrades, a laboratory that analyzes wine. What he discovered shocked him.\n\n\"Some very, very high levels of arsenic,\" Hicks said.\n\nHe tested more than 1,300 bottles of wine. Almost a quarter of them had levels higher than the EPA's maximum allowable amount of arsenic in drinking water: 10 parts per billion. No one can say for sure why, but Hicks noticed a pattern.\n\n\"The lower the price of wine on a per-liter basis, the higher the amount of arsenic,\" he said.\n\nThey included Trader Joe's famed Two-Buck Chuck White Zinfandel, which came in at three times the limit, a bottle of Ménage à Trois Moscato was four times the limit and a Franzia White Grenache had five times the EPA limit for drinking water.\n\nHe took the test results to some of those wine companies.\n\n\"Most wine companies, when I mention arsenic and wine in the same sentence, literally almost hung up the phone on me,\" he said.\n\nThe next step, he said, was to supply the data to a law firm.\n\n\"He was trying to get their attention; he was trying to blow the whistle on them,\" attorney Brian Kabateck said.\n\nThursday, he plans to file a class action lawsuit in California accusing more than 24 California winemakers and sellers of misrepresenting their wine as safe.\n\n\"We've done testing with two separate labs,\" Kabateck said.\n\nHe said they've checked Hicks' results and they \"absolutely\" stand up.\n\nCBS News took those results to epidemiologist Allan Smith, associate director of the Arsenic Health Effects research program at U.C. Berkeley.\n\n\"These are about two to three times in this particular sample, the drinking water standard, and they vary, they fluctuated, but some of them were up to three, four or five times the drinking water standard,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith said 50 parts per billion of arsenic -- the highest level found in one of the bottles Hicks tested -- can be deadly over time.\n\nEven though \"parts per billion\" seems like a very small amount, Smith said \"Arsenic is highly toxic; it's astonishing.\"\n\n\"It has as many effects inside the body as cigarette smoking does,\" Smith said.\n\nBut he based that on studies of drinking water, which is the only beverage with an arsenic limit set by the U.S. government.\n\n\"We estimate that approximately 1 in 100 people who drink water like that throughout their life will die from the arsenic, ultimately, due to mostly cancers from it,\" Smith said.\n\nThe federal government doesn't regulate wine like it does water, and a spokesperson for The Wine Group, one of the companies named in the lawsuit, told CBS News, \"It would not be accurate or responsible to use the water standard as the baseline\" because people generally drink more water than wine. He also pointed out that the highest level of arsenic cited in the lawsuit is \"only half of Canada's standard for wine, of 100 parts per billion.\"\n\nThe FDA said it only handles contaminates in food and beverages on a \"case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"The industry, we believe, is not properly regulated, but the state of California has recognized the 10 parts per billion is a dangerous amount,\" Kabateck said.\n\nHe's interpreting a California law that requires businesses to warn consumers if their products contain \"a chemical known to the state to cause cancer.\" California's threshold for arsenic is 10 parts per billion, the same as the EPA's water standard, but The Wine Institute, an advocacy group for California winemakers, said the industry already provides warning signs to be posted in retail stores.\n\nThe California attorney general's office confirmed that's all the law requires, but some think that's not enough.\n\n\"I think that all beverages should aim to meet the drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion,\" Smith said.\n\nTwo other defendants named in the lawsuit responded to CBS News' request for comment.

{"text": "AGE has a look more associated with children's anime (no surprise then that this show's writer and character designer also worked on projects like Inazuma Eleven). Despite all this, the show isn't really \"childish\" in any sense, and ends up being a typical Gundam show--or a sad attempt at being one.Yes, Gundam AGE is no doubt the worst Gundam out there. Okay, I haven't seen fan disfavourite SEED Destiny outside of the first few episodes, but it'll have to be pretty bad to beat what writer Akihiro Hino and director Susumu Yamaguchi have presented us with here. They've presented us with a show that could have been a very solid show but instead refuses every attempt at being good.Basically, Gundam AGE is a \"multigenerational Gundam\", which focuses on protagonist Flit Asuno, his son, and his grandson, all of which pilot three generations of the titular Gundam AGE. From that summary alone, I'd expect a very interesting plot involving intense familial themes, some romance, and perhaps some grand villainous threat that threatens the Asuno clan and their friends and their society over the decades. Instead this is merely a setup for infinite amounts of squandered opportunities at interesting plot threads. Take the expected romantic themes--relationships are reduced to little more than a casual mention at best, with pathetic attempts at creating love triangles that the concept art for the later characters made painfully obvious which girl \"won\", seeing how each son resembles their mother. \"Won\" belongs in quotes because little to no characterisation is given to any of the girls and love interests besides perhaps Yurin, who is a carbon copy of Lalah Sune from the original 0079 Gundam. Speaking of Yurin, we also get a scene so bizarre early on that it seems like a parody of the battle involving Lalah, Amuro, and Char from the original Gundam, involving a psychotic little kid as Char. Oh, that scene is also completely serious and sets up one of the major story threads, something so bad it puts all the borrowing of the original MSG plot Gundam SEED did to shame.That's only a taste of the plot you'll find in this show. Gundam AGE effectively has three story arcs separated by timeskips, centering around Flit in the first, his son Asem in the second, and his grandson Kio in the third. It wouldn't be a stretch to say the first is \"based on\" Mobile Suit Gundam, the second on Zeta Gundam, and the third on ZZ Gundam. The first arc is pretty much junk--a shadowy faction with strange mobile suits are blowing up colonies, but it mostly ends up being a mixture of filler and dumb ripoffs of the original Gundam. The rest is better though, if only because it gets to answer the question of what Gundam protagonists and their comrades are doing decades after the events of their show, and Gundam AGE delivers for the second arc, which ends up being the only salvageable part of the show in the end. Here we see Flit's friend Woolf as a grizzled badass, Flit himself playing a role equivalent to the villainous Titans of Zeta Gundam, and that's sadly about it, because while the second arc presents an interesting story, it squanders its true potential by wasting about a third of its space with rather pointless high school filler arc that does little but set up the character of Gundam AGE's Char clone Zeheart. The arc also unceremoniously wastes an interesting plot point by killing off one of the most interesting characters of the first generation for no reason only a few minutes after he's reintroduced for the second arc. But at least we have a solid plot--angry humans on Mars want to take back the Earth, and start a total war with the Earth Sphere humans, which amounts to typical Gundam stuff. Oh, and look for a ripoff of one of the ending scenes of Gundam Wing (or Char's Counterattack, which Gundam Wing borrowed from) because Gundam AGE can't resist stealing famous Gundam scenes for its own use (although I admit this scene is pretty cool).The third arc and the finale are what ends up utterly killing the show. Everything comes together to produce a flat nothing, with a corny plot development leading to protagonist Kio Asuno turning into perhaps the whiniest Gundam protagonist ever. This plot development involving him going to the home colony of the Mars humans ends up being horribly, horribly done, even though the writers no doubt intended it to be one of the tearjerking moments of the show. This also shows Gundam AGE's love for killing off characters in dramatic death scenes when they barely have been given any character development. Not that that stops them from giving a full episode devoted to a minor character introduced only the previous episode which goes into detail about her life, only for her to be killed off at the end of it. Nice misplaced priorities there, eh?The ending is as bad as", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Towards the end of my 45 minutes with Louis van Gaal his eyes lit up when our conversation turned to his great 1995 Ajax side. The sternness disappeared from the new Manchester United manager's face as he pointed to his tactics board and recited the names in his young Champions League winning team of 19 years ago.\n\nHe spoke of Edgar Davids and Clarence Seedorf and how his young stars from that era glided around the pitch as one. I had taken him back to his football heaven: young players, all products of his \"philosophy\", performing in perfect synchronicity. \"I actually played with 17-year-old players in a [Champions League] final,\" he reminded me. \"So don't say to me that youngsters cannot play football. When you are fitting in a philosophy you can do a lot. And of course Seedorf was playing at 17 in a final. And Seedorf was a fantastic player. [Patrick] Kluivert was 18 – and he scored a goal.\" The winning goal in a 1-0 victory over AC Milan.\n\nThe first 20 minutes of our conversation had been a sermon to which I listened intently. I had five aims in mind on my first trip to my old training ground at Carrington for two years: 1, To listen to a great coach; 2, To ask what he has found out about United in the past five weeks; 3, To see what message he has for fans who are desperate for signings; 4, To discuss the big tactical change to 3-5-2; And 5, To learn what ambitions he has for United for the three years of his contract.\n\nThe best-laid plans go out of the window. This was no old pals' act. There I am, with my notebook of questions, walking towards the long table where Louis van Gaal sits. He is an imposing figure. The light is low. Only one person is going to be in charge of this interview and it's not going to be me. This man is not going to be pushed.\n\nOnce the informal conversation had ended I asked Van Gaal if we could chat in a more structured, journalistic way. \"Chat? Not any more, because I have other work to do, also,\" he said. I thought I was out on my ear. But he relented: \"I never have secrets, so you can ask what you want.\" As I leave he tells me: \"Three-quarters of an hour is too much, normally.\"\n\nBefore I can start with the questions, Van Gaal beats me to it. He lays his palm on the desk. \"I have a notebook, for you,\" he says. \"It's always what I show my players. You can make the system that we're playing now.\"\n\nHe is inviting me to prove to him that I understand how United now line-up.\n\nI'm on the back foot. The gauntlet has been thrown down.\n\n\"You want me to?\" I say.\n\n\"Yeah, of course,\" he says. \"You can do that. Or not?\"\n\nBy now I feel a prickly heat. I say: \"I'll have a go, but you're going to tell me I'm wrong.\"\n\nVan Gaal gives me a penetrating look: \"You are a little bit ... shy?\"\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later, I leave his office feeling drained. This was the first time in 30 years I had been called \"shy\". But what followed was a series of fascinating insights into Van Gaal's philosophy on football and his plans for United, which are based on youth, \"always the long-term\", and guiding the players through a three-month crash-course in how he wants them to operate.\n\nEvery great coach is resolute about their philosophy. Van Gaal is entrenched. It must be his way or no way at all. Last season, I confess, I was worried about United after a disastrous campaign. I was concerned about where the club would go next. There was talk straight after David Moyes left that a foreign manager would come in. I had seen what had happened at other clubs, where a 60-year philosophy is ripped up in favour of three-year cycles, with each new manager turning the culture upside down. I left Carrington feeling that Van Gaal is, in fact, true to the traditions laid down by Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. I'm not saying he will stay 25 years. But he holds to the same principles.\n\nHe offers reassurance: \"My teams shall improve through the season,\" he says. \"That is not a question,\" meaning – that is not in doubt. \"They shall improve.\"\n\nThey say that in interviews you should \"grab the room\". Well, Van Gaal, and not me, grabbed the room. Rising to switch a light on, I was again beaten to it by the new boss.\n\n\"You", "label": "real"}

That could help us understand why we are here.\"\n\nStar HD 162826 is located in the lower leg of the constellation Hercules.

Using the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas, and coordinating with researchers at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, Ramirez narrowed the list by analyzing the orbit and chemical makeup of each star. Under the research, HD 162826 was the only star in the group that satisfied the team's \"dynamical and chemical criteria for being a true sibling of the Sun.\"\n\nEvidence suggests sibling stars may host Earth-like exoplanets that might be capable of supporting life -- so by investigating the origins of the sun, researchers may also be advancing the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\n\"The idea is if a planet has life, like Earth, and if you hit it with an asteroid, it will create debris, some of which will escape into space,\" astronomer Mauri Valtonen of the University of Turku in Finland told Space.com in 2012. \"And if the debris is big enough, like 1 meter across, it can shield life inside from radiation, and that life can survive inside for millions of years until that debris lands somewhere.

{"text": "Le beau est aussi utile que l'utile -- Victor Hugo\n\n(The beautiful is as useful as the useful)\n\nFrench Bicycles\n\nFrench bicycles are often of very high quality, but they have their own idiosyncracies and interchangeability problems. This article tries to point out the pitfalls that you may run into in maintaining or upgrading a French bicycle, and offers solutions to common problems. In the great bike boom of the early-mid '70's, French bicycles were sold in the U.S. in very large numbers, mostly low-end ten speeds with mild steel frames, steel rims and cottered cranks. These low-end models are generally not worth putting any money into, unless you have a strong sentimental attachment to one. Such a bike can be suitable for use as a \"beater\" to ride short distances, perhaps to the train station where you can lock it up without worrying about theft. [A note from John Allen: I think that Sheldon overgeneralizes here. Some of the low-end models make for a very nice ride if customized with better components. I'm not the only cyclist who praises the excellent handling qualities of the UO-8, Peugeot's bottom-of-the-line 1970s 10-speed. There are probably other low-grade French bicycles as good. The UO-8 frame has unusually long chainstays, for ample heel clearance when carrying rear panniers. The plain-gauge steel frame tubing is a bit heavier than fancier butted tubing, but the added stiffness is welcome when carrying a touring load, and plain-gauge tubing doesn't dent easily like thin-walled butted tubing. A UO-8 is my favorite touring bike. So there!] Higher quality French bicycles, with cotterless cranks and aluminum rims are usually worth restoring or upgrading. These bicycles are also often a good choice for conversion for fixed-gear use. Unfortunately, some of the dimensions and thread standards used on older French bicycles can make it difficult to find suitable parts for repair or upgrading. [Also in connection with this article, see Sheldon's article on upgrading...John Allen]\n\nSome dimensional differences:\n\nThese have a reputation for failure, and should be replaced. Many higher-quality French bicycles of the '70's came with AVA brand bars and stems. French stems differ both in the size that fits into the steerer, and the size of the part that clamps on to the handlebar. Thus, if you want to replace the handlebars on a French bicycle, you will probably also need to replace the stem. French stems are 0.2mm narrower than others where they fit into the steering column. A standard 7/8\" / 22.2mm stem won't usually fit. In many cases, the limiting factor for fitting the stem in will be the headset locknut, rather than the steerer itself. Try removing the locknut before sanding down a stem. If the headset locknut is slightly tighter than the steerer, it can be enlarged easily with a small grinding wheel. In cases where the stem really won't fit into the steerer, a few minutes' work on the stem with sandpaper will usually do the trick. Wrap the sandpaper around the stem, grip it with your hand, and turn the stem round and round until it fits. You only need to remove 0.1 mm, which is 1/250\", not much at all! [This needs to be a quill-type stem, which inserts into the steerer tube, and an aluminum alloy stem, not a steel one -- from which you would be removing chrome plating, leaving it vulnerable to rust. Another approach is to replace the fork and the headset with ones with standard British/ISO dimensions. This is possible, as French head tube bearing race dimensions are 30.2mm, the same as British. You could use a standard 22.2 mm quill stem, or a threadless headset and a 1-inch Aheadset-type stem. Also, an adapter is available as of 2014 to fit a 1 1/8\" Aheadset-type stem to a French fork.-- John Allen] If you convert from a French stem to a standard one, you will also need to replace the handlebars, which are a different diameter.\n\nHeadsets\n\nThe threaded parts of a French headset are non-standard, but the press-in parts are conventional. If you have a worn-out headset, it is most likely the lower races that are damaged. If you have trouble finding a French headset, you can replace the bottom races with ones from a standard headset, and keep the old parts on top. French headsets use a different type of keyed washer than others. Instead of having a groove machined in the threads, the rear part of the threads is filed flat.

It actually sounds pretty good through the cheap speakers I was using for it, but it is flawed in a few ways. Number one is the turn on sound that is both high pitched and loud. Why it needs this is beyond me when it already has LED lights that come on for TX and RX which would be a good indication of it being functional without this noise. The second is that the Bluetooth range is terrible, like less than 5 feet. Perhaps it is where I was testing it on my bench, but even after soldering a 5 inch piece of wire to the antenna trace it still only made it 10-12 feet. As for volume, it gets loud enough that I would not turn it up all the way. For a source I used an iPhone 6s plus that I am tinkering with on my bench. I ran a few Youtube music videos from acts ranging from Linkin Park to Fleetwood Mac to test a wide range of sounds. It did not put out much bass, but that may be down to the rather low end speakers I was using in the test (from an old Aiwa bookshelf system) rather than the unit itself. I want to try it out on different hardware, but the turn on sound gives me pause as to whether or not I wish to use it in a project-it is that annoying.\n\nX Previous image Next image\n\nVerified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: 2012moon816", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Photo Mike Colter stars in the new Netflix superhero series \"Marvel's Luke Cage,\" available on Friday. Credit Netflix\n\nIn the connected series of movies and television shows known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which occupies an inordinate amount of territory in our popular culture, there's a quiet corner that belongs to Netflix. The Netflix-Marvel series, focusing on a mostly second-tier group of heroes — so far Daredevil, Jessica Jones and, beginning on Friday, Luke Cage — have been a laboratory in turning comic books into live-action TV without the noisy battles and tag-team group heroics of Marvel mainstays like the Avengers, X-Men and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nBut what's most distinctive about the series is the way it puts race — and specifically pride in Harlem, where the show takes place — at the center of the story. It's not just that Cage (Mike Colter of \"The Good Wife\") is engaged in a battle for the neighborhood's soul with Cottonmouth (Mahershala Ali, \"House of Cards\"), a local crime boss. That's a plot we've seen plenty of times.\n\nGet expert TV and movie recommendations from the Watching newsletter The best of what to watch and where to watch it, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

See Sample\n\nManage Email Preferences\n\nNot you?\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nIt's the steady drumbeat of visual and spoken references to Harlem's history and culture, which depending on your taste can come off as an inspiring refrain or as facile name-dropping. The occasional reference to a Beyoncé or Denzel is lost among the citations of past and present neighborhood figures, from Langston Hughes and Billy Strayhorn to Percy Sutton, Geoffrey Canada and ASAP Rocky.\n\nA corrupt politician's self-serving development plan is called the New Harlem Renaissance. The camera has a habit of catching the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building on 125th Street, with its striding statue of Powell. Dapper Dan, the \"hip-hop tailor of Harlem,\" appears as himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis approach has a couple of effects, beyond the unusual (for the superhero genre) and welcome element of diversity. The selling of Harlem as a literary-artistic wonderland is distracting in what's basically a straightforward, middling-quality comic-book adaptation about a reluctant hero taking on gangsters and crooked politicians.\n\nAnd it often feels like the cultural lessons are getting in the way of the genre fun. There's more conversation than action, and the talk has a tendency to slide into debate, about vigilantism or competing ideas of Harlem or visions of the solitary black hero. (Cage is a Walter Mosley -Easy Rawlins man, while his mentor, Pops, prefers Donald Goines and his more radical crime-fighter, Kenyatta.) It's as if we're listening to a series of long-running circular arguments rather than watching a drama with some forward momentum. It doesn't help that the show's place in the Marvel continuum forces it to start midstream — after the action of \"Jessica Jones,\" in which Mr. Colter's Cage had a significant role — which leads to a flashback-heavy structure to shoehorn in the origin stories of Cage and other characters.\n\nThere's plenty to like about \"Luke Cage,\" including the gorgeous Harlem locations; good work in supporting roles by Alfre Woodard and Ron Cephas Jones; and lively performances by musicians like Raphael Saadiq, Charles Bradley and Jidenna . But if you make the inevitable comparison to \"Jessica Jones,\" the show from which it was semispun off, it looks decidedly average. Mr. Colter was better served there, playing a stoic Cage in a supporting role — here he doesn't seem comfortable carrying the show. And \"Jones\" pulled off the trick of being both a compelling narrative and a smart, frightening commentary (in that case, on predatory male behavior). \"Cage\" tries to do a similar thing with racial politics but gets lost in platitudes. Its messages don't get under your skin.", "label": "real"}

{"text": "To learn about a leader, ignore their manifesto and just remove their constraints. Power reveals and absolute power reveals absolutely. It is an extreme way of getting to know someone, granted, but not too extreme for the British to try.\n\nOn June 9, the morning after the general election that she announced on Tuesday, Theresa May could be the most powerful prime minister since the second world war. Tony Blair was checked by a sullen chancellor of the exchequer. Margaret Thatcher had to reckon with trade unions that still mattered. Mrs May will have no comparable nuisances and, to believe the polls that give her Conservatives a lead almost equal to the Labour party's entire vote share, the kind of majority that reduces parliament to a formal imprimatur.\n\nFor the next seven weeks, Mrs May will try and fail to interest the media in her domestic reforms. This is a Europe campaign by another name, the first single-issue election since Edward Heath asked voters to choose between his premiership and trade union power in 1974. And it should be: the terms of Britain's exit from the EU are more material to the nation's future than any education policy or fiscal loosening.\n\nMrs May's victory will buy little to no leverage over the EU, which cannot allow the vagaries of national politics to cloud its interest in a tough exit for the UK. But it will push her political horizon from 2020 to 2022. She can now contemplate a longer transition from membership to non-membership, even at the cost of continued free movement of Europeans into Britain and a contribution to the EU budget. Any angry voters will have to wait years to punish her, by which time she may have retired to a nicer life of rural hikes and Ottolenghi recipes.\n\nA vast majority would also allow Mrs May to pass whatever exit terms she secures through parliament. It frees her from bothersome colleagues.\n\nFT View Theresa May's snap election call is right for Brexit Britain The prime minister needs flexibility to secure a sensible settlement\n\nThe question is, which ones? Some pro-Europeans assume that absolute power will reveal a moderate managerialist of a prime minister, an erstwhile Remainer who will shape a softish exit now that zealots to her right cannot block it in parliament. Sterling's performance on Tuesday reflected this hope. Deutsche Bank has revised its bleak expectations for growth because, in part, an election will \"dilute the influence of MPs pushing for hard Brexit\".\n\nThe trouble is that it will also dilute the influence of MPs pushing for soft or gradual exit. It will neuter John Redwood, the hardliner, but it will do the same to Anna Soubry, the inexhaustible defender of the Tory left. To assume that Mrs May is nearer to the second remains as durable a myth as her supposed indecision. Power might reveal a more thoroughgoing conservative than the markets realise. True, she is thought to oppose an abrupt exit without a trade deal or transitional arrangement, but so would almost anyone in her position. It is not much to cling to. It says nothing about the terms of the transition or the eventual degree of market access.\n\nA very, very bad deal might have worse long-term consequences than no deal at all — and, as of June, it will be easier to pass. What really faded on Tuesday was not hard exit but the prospect of a reversal or dilution of last year's referendum. Until now, a pro-European could believe that Mrs May would agree a deal too bad for parliament to wear, necessitating a second attempt at negotiation under a new prime minister or an election fought on the question of whether to leave at all. That hope has dropped from faint to near-zero.\n\nFT Politics podcast Special: Theresa May calls a snap general election With Janan Ganesh, George Parker and Miranda Green of the Financial Times. Presented by Sebastian Payne.\n\nIf there is a limit to Mrs May's power after June, it will be Scotland. Those who ran the successful campaign to preserve the UK in 2014 give some credit to Labour's poll lead ahead of the general election that was due the next year. Scots who disliked the Tories could vote for the union in the hope they would only be governed by them for a few more months. Those voters can now expect large Conservative majorities in Westminster as far as the eye can see, starting in June. Mrs May must govern magnanimously to avoid provoking them to nationalism. It is not much of a constraint but it will have to do. The others expire in seven weeks.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com", "label": "real"}
{"text": "Mike Arnold, Eugene-based lawyer & One Gro founder\n\nIn a small café just off I-5 that proprietors hope to convert into a weed dispensary, a marijuana company's leaders met with a few citizens of Creswell last week in an attempt to change hearts and minds — and a city ordinance — about the pot industry.\n\nOne Gro is a marijuana company started by Mike Arnold, the Eugene-based lawyer who briefly defended the Bundys after their Malheur occupation last year and who recently left his law practice to become a \"gentleman hobbyist farmer\" growing and selling pot outside of Creswell.\n\nArnold and his CEO, Dan Isaacson, hope that One Gro will soon have its flagship dispensary in Creswell — population 5,292. The twist, however, is that Creswell citizens voted 1,280-1,152 in November to ban weed dispensaries in town.\n\nThe company started up in February and recently filed an initiative petition to reverse the ban. \"The reason we wrote the law the way we did is so we could be the only dispensary in town,\" Isaacson says. \"It won't be like Eugene, where it's stacked one on top of another.\"\n\nDave Stram, Creswell's mayor, says, \"My official position is that the citizens made a decision eight months ago that they did not want marijuana in this city.\" The city is situated in the midst of choice farmland and located right next to I-5 and near an airport.\n\nStram adds, \"Creswell is a prime spot for this industry. I certainly can't fault them for wanting to be here. My issue is why do they want to be here when we already voted no.\"\n\nIsaacson often calls Creswell \"our Cupertino,\" after the California headquarters of Apple. Arnold and his team want to set up shop in Creswell as a national weed operation, selling products like a weed inhaler for medical usage.\n\n\"We're not looking to build a dispensary or to build a cannabis company, we're looking to build a cannabis empire,\" Isaacson says. \"We bring traditional business into pot and sell it in a way to not market it to potheads.\"\n\nIsaacson suggests that with a 3 percent tax on their shop, the city could raise $160,000 in annual revenue. \"We have to have law enforcement, which means we're shy about 100 grand,\" he says.\n\nArnold proposed that the 3 percent tax the city might take from his business venture could go towards hiring more sheriff's deputies, who currently don't patrol in the early morning hours. \"Anyone drive around here at 2 or 3 in the morning? This place is sketchy,\" he said.\n\nStram says he has run the numbers for what marijuana taxes could bring to Creswell, and he thinks it'll be more a trickle of revenue than a stream. Similarly sized Veneta made $30,000 in revenue off $1 million in marijuana sales, so even generously doubling that profit to $2 million leaves Creswell with $60,000 in taxes.\n\n\"That doesn't cover police officers,\" Stram says. \"I doubt that a recreational dispensary in Creswell would bring many jobs here, and when I go down to the shop, none of them live in Creswell.\"\n\nThe tax wouldn't be implemented until after the 2018 election, when voters would, at least in theory, vote to tax marijuana sales. If the petition passes in an election this fall, that tax would automatically go on the 2018 ballot, but it would leave One Gro operating tax-free for a year.\n\nIsaacson says the company is committed to donating 3 percent of its profits to a local nonprofit to show goodwill in the community. \"There's an outsider aspect to it, like why are you in our community? I thought we [should] write the rule in such a way that it gave them the opportunity to know that we're stewards to the community.\"\n\nSome in the community have raised concerns that an election is quite expensive. Arnold responds that the city could pass the legislation if it feels \"the will of the people has been met.\" He adds, \"But they won't do that because most politicians are cowards.\"\n\nArnold says of the petition, \"What we're doing is coming into town voluntarily, begging to give 3 percent of our gross proceeds to Creswell.\"\n\nStram says the City Council decided that the marijuana issue was so important it needed to be in the hands of the people, so the council would leave it to the voters. \"Creswellians are not happy with their presence or them pushing their will upon the city,\" he says of One Gro, though he added that some likely are excited for the opportunity to vote again.\n\nThe Friday, July 21, meeting at the NakD Bean café was unusual, as political", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Bloomberg recently declared the era of fossil fuels irrevocably in decline: \"The world is now adding more capacity for renewable power each year than coal, natural gas, and oil combined. And there's no going back.\"\n\n\nThe sea change in how we power our economies officially occurred in 2013, Bloomberg's Tom Randall writes in \"Fossil Fuels Just Lost the Race Against Renewables.\" That year, there were 143 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity capacity added globally, versus just 141 GW of new fossil-fueled capacity.\n\nDespite low oil prices, the trend toward renewables is not going to slow down anytime soon, given that the cost of solar and wind power has steadily fallen to the point that it is now cheaper than grid electricity in some parts of the world, Randall argues. \"The shift will continue to accelerate, and by 2030 more than four times as much renewable capacity will be added.\"\n\n\nThat's for electricity generation, of course, but before you can officially call the race in renewables' favor, you have to consider transport. Our cars and trucks and planes mostly run on fossil fuels, after all. As Vox's Brad Plumer points out, \"Electricity and heat were only responsible for about 42 percent of global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in 2012. For clean energy to truly win the race, it will have to make inroads in other sectors as well, particularly transportation.\"\n\n\nAn analysis by the International Energy Agency found that the amount of energy used for transport has doubled over the past three decades, and that slightly more than half of all oil is used for transport.\n\n\nLight duty vehicles drove the growth in transport-sector fuel use, according to the IEA, and will continue to do so without further policies to promote fuel efficiency and low-carbon transportation alternatives, especially in developing countries, where individual car ownership is on the rise. Total energy use by the transport sector could increase by as much as 70% by 2050, the IEA found.\n\n\nThe figures that informed Randall's determination that fossil fuels are officially over came from Michael Liebreich's keynote address at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit held last month in New York City. In his presentation, Liebreich predicted that we'll soon see battery storage and electric vehicles achieve the same sort of technological innovation and lower costs that solar and wind energy have enjoyed in recent years.\n\n\nIf so, expanded use of electric vehicles couldn't come at a better time, just as clean energy is increasingly a part of the mix that will be powering those zero emission cars.\n\n\nIt's not just that more clean energy is available, it's also that more and more coal is going offline. A recent report by BNEF predicted that 2015 \"should prove to be a watershed year for the 'de-carbonization' of the US power sector, with record volumes of coal-fired capacity to be shuttered, renewables capacity to be built, and natural gas to be consumed,\" according to a press release.\n\n\nAs Vox's Plumer reminds us, however, looking at the broader picture is always instructive.\n\nAll told, fossil fuels made up 87 percent of the world's primary energy consumption in 2013. By contrast, low-carbon sources — including nuclear, hydropower, wind, solar, and biomass — made up just 13 percent.\n\n\nThat ratio hasn't changed since 1999, as the University of Colorado's Roger Pielke Jr. points out. In other words, the world's energy supply hasn't gotten any cleaner for 14 years.\n\nFossil fuels are hardly limping along, in other words, and we all know that fossil fuels interests will not go down without a fight.\n\n\nIt's probably premature to call the race in clean energy's favor at this point, for all that there are a number of encouraging signs that a transformation in how we power human civilization is at hand.\n\n\nAnd that's without even considering one wild card in all this, the attempts by American coal companies like Peabody Energy to paint their product as a solution to global poverty while desperately pursuing overseas markets. Could US coal find enough new customers in the developing world to buy itself a longer lease on life? Time will tell.\n\n\nBut according to Gabe Elsner, executive director of the Energy & Policy Institute, there's reason to hope the developing world will refuse to get hooked on coal. \"Leaders in Africa don't want coal, or they want it temporarily,\" Elsner tells DeSmog. \"They don't see it as a solution to energy poverty.\"\n\n\nElsner points to a video from the Powering Africa Summit, in which \"All but one person interviewed said that there was no role for Peabody's coal in Africa and many advocated for renewable energy as the right path forward for the nations of Africa.\"\n\n\nIn the meantime, Leibreich had a slide in his BNEF presentation that provides an interesting peak into the coal industry's own perception of the", "label": "real"}

Decoding Bitcoin\n\nChances are you have never used a Bitcoin, but you've probably heard of it.\n\nThe virtual currency is popping up more and more in the news and the government has been showing an increased interest in the subject.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor instance, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee this week told federal financial regulators and law enforcement officials to explain how they are keeping tabs on \"virtual\" currencies, including the $1.2 billion market for Bitcoins.\n\nSo what, errr, is a Bitcoin?\n\nWhat follows is guide to understanding the currency, why it's used and why the government is paying attention.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin?\n\nAt its most basic level a Bitcoin is a form of money that can be used to pay for products or services just like the dollar bills that sit in your wallet.\n\nA Bitcoin lives as code inside a computer. It's intangible, but it works in many ways like cold, hard cash.\n\nTo acquire a Bitcoin, you need to buy it with another currency or have someone send it to you in a transaction. To hold a Bitcoin, you need to keep it in a digital \"wallet,\" a piece of software, on your local computer or you can you can allow a company to hold your \"wallet\" on their servers.\n\nBitcoin payments are made by transferring the digital currency between two users' \"wallets.\" The fees for these transfers are lower than for more traditional forms of payments, like using a credit card or a bank transfer, because they are not backed by the safeguards and intermediary services provided by companies like Visa or Bank of America.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Bitcoin: Tax haven of the future)\n\nThis means Bitcoin payments can usually be made more quickly and cheaply but they lack safety nets that come with using a more established system, such as deposit insurance and being able to contest a credit card charge.\n\n\"For your average person, there's no good reason to have large sums of money in Bitcoin,\" said Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. \"You want to buy Bitcoin when you want to use it for something.\"\n\nA retailer and merchant has to be willing to accept Bitcoins as a payment and right now not many do.\n\nThe dating site OkCupid and WordPress.com are among the businesses that have started to accept Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is \"decentralized\" meaning that it's created and maintained by a network, rather than controlled by an institution like the Federal Reserve. The monetary policy of Bitcoin has already been established in a sense, with a cap of 21 million Bitcoins being able to enter circulation to reduce the risk of inflation.\n\nRight now the price of a Bitcoin is around $100.\n\nYou might have heard that Bitcoin transactions are anonymous. That's not entirely true and reflects only part of the utility of the currency. Bitcoin backers stress that it is really semi-anonymous, meaning that all transactions are publicly recorded on a so-called \"block chain,\" a sort of ledger, but that you have control over how much identifying information to provide.\n\n\"What Bitcoin offers to the average user is a way to make cash-like transactions on the Internet, where by transferring ownership you have transferred that actual asset, as opposed to just transferring a debt,\" said Adam Levine, editor-in-chief of the podcast Let's Talk Bitcoin!\n\nWhy is the government interested?\n\nBitcoin and other virtual currencies are increasingly drawing the attention of federal and state officials, though many have yet to formally express their views.\n\nThe chief worries have been whether they can be used by criminals to launder money, sell drugs, fleece unsuspecting consumers or evade taxes.\n\nThe Treasury Department and state governments have taken steps to require some Bitcoin businesses to register and meet certain requirements because of concerns around money laundering and consumer protection.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is pursuing a case against an alleged Bitcoin Ponzi scheme and the Government Accountability Office has recommended that the IRS issue guidance for taxpayers on the reporting requirements for Bitcoins and other digital currencies.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Congress starts looking into Bitcoin)\n\nMeanwhile, New York state financial regulators have subpoenaed Bitcoin businesses and raised the possibility of \"new regulatory guidelines.\"\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee is quizzing these agencies about what they are doing to oversee these markets and to make sure there is a coordinated approach.\n\nBitcoin supporters are already worried about too many government tentacles in the market.\n\n\"Bitcoin today is poised to be that kind of success potentially but right now if you want to start a Bitcoin business before day one, before you can open your doors you have to get licensing from 48 different states,\" Brito said. \"I hope we can get policymakers to address their concerns while not being an", "label": "real"}

{"text": "Poet Mab Jones explores the concept of 'Hiraeth' in the poetry of Wales and further afield\n\nHiraeth, a central theme of Welsh language poetry and song, is a feeling of something lost, a long time ago, whether national identity or a once-important language.\n\nIt has deep roots - some link it to the loss of self-determination in 1282. It has no equivalent in English, often translating as 'homesickness', but incorporating an aspect of impossibility: the pining for a home, a person, even a national history that may never have actually existed. To feel hiraeth is to experience a deep sense of incompleteness. Longing and absence has infused Welsh songs and poetry for centuries, so perhaps in the national temperament there's a perpetual tension between staying and leaving, a yearning for something better, a grief for something left behind. But there are equivalents in other languages - in Portuguese, 'saudade' is an impossible longing for the unattainable, so there are occurrences of the sentiment across a wide cultural spectrum.\n\nBut if the English don't have a word for it, does that mean they don't feel it, or that they don't need it? For some, like Mab's former Professor at Swansea, M Wynn Thomas, 'hiraeth' can function as a default nostalgia button, and a dangerous tendency to believe things were better in the past. It's an experience characteristic of the powerless, the dispossessed; it's the signature tune of loss, but is this hopeless and persistent longing holding this small nation back?\n\nMab Jones is a poet and performer both humorous and deeply serious. She stands outside the Welsh language tradition, claims she doesn't feel hiraeth (not for Wales anyway - possibly for Japan), and for Radio 4 questions and pokes at the concept, visiting the National Eisteddfod for the first time in an attempt to put her finger on exactly what it is. Exploring the concept through poetry that expresses it, from the poets Menna Elfyn and Ifor ap Glyn she hears poems and songs that deal with aspects of Welsh history that might explain the continued existence of the word in Welsh - forced removals from much loved homes through industrialisation and military eviction. And she talks to writers who live between two worlds and struggle with a sense of belonging: Pamela Petro, an American writer who fell in love with the landscape of Wales in her twenties, and Eric Charles Ngalle, a Cameroonian poet and refugee, who made a life in Wales while unable to turn his mind to his original home, and the trauma that made him leave his family aged 17.", "label": "real"}

At the time, it was 14 barges with simple lighting floating around the lagoon to a song from 1967 called \"Baroque Hoedown.\" Disneyland management in attendance at the festivities were looking for a new piece on nighttime entertainment for Disneyland, as the current offering of fireworks just wasn't keeping people in the park into the late evening. Many people were generally leaving Disneyland around 6:00PM each evening.\n\nCard Walker called Bob Jani and Ron Miziker and told them that they had to do something for Disneyland. They didn't want the world to forget about Disneyland, with all this press for Disney World going on. Ron Miziker went down to the Anaheim public library and came across an interesting article about how, at the turn of the 20th century when electricity was a new thing, people in cities would string light-bulbs together and parade down the street with it.\n\nMY LATEST VIDEOS MY LATEST VIDEOS\n\nThey contracted a designer named Ken Dresser who was brought in to start laying out concepts and ideas. They made a presentation to Card Walker and other executives who immediately said \"let's do it.\" The first question became \"How are we going to power such a thing?\" They couldn't use generators legally, plus they were noisy and smelly, so it wasn't ideal. Engineer Jerry Hefferly from the Disneyland maintenance department kept trying to do what he could with batteries, but it never seemed to work. They even talked about electrifying the trolley tracks on Main Street at one point.\n\nDick Nunis, Vice President of Disneyland felt the attraction was unnecessary as Disneyland was opening Country Bear Jamboree in 1972 anyway. A final ultimatum was given in January 1972 that they had two weeks to solve the issues or the project was cancelled. New batteries called nickel-cadmium batteries that were light-weight had just comes out and it looked like they would be the solution with just 3 days left to go. After some tests, it was decided this was the solution was strong enough to power the lights, sound system, and power units that would be used to drive the floats. They could make it through the park one way before having to be recharged for a second performance.\n\nWith that solved, it still wasn't the end of the troubles. The decision to use the small Christmas-style lights was a problem as only one manufacturer made them and they were only white-color lights that required hand dipping the lights into a color medium. The company Sylvestri in Chicago was contracted to build the units for a large sum of money. When Ron Miziker took a trip to Chicago to check on the project 1.5 months prior to opening, not much of the float construction was done. Ron and Bob decided that everything that already existed would be shipped to California and would be finished there. A giant circus tent was erected backstage at Disneyland in preparation for the arrival of 14 moving vans full of the Main Street Electrical Parade. Electricians and carpenters were hired to work in shifts 24 hours a day to complete the parade in the remaining time.\n\nWith none of the floats completed, the first two scheduled parade rehearsals were cancelled and only one rehearsal was held. It was a disaster. Floats fell apart, cast members were being shocked, and floats were not finishing the route. This was two days before the parade was set to debut.\n\nAt the first official performance on June 17, 1972, Bob and Ron were standing behind the parade gate. As the floats were readying to move from backstage to Main Street, the lights on the units were lighted for the first time. Dozens of electricians were still working on the lights and were hopping off just before each unit went through the gates into public view. Ron said, \"The sight of that happening was like people jumping ship just prior to it sinking.\" The original floats that night included the Blue Fairy, Casey Junior Circus Train, Alice In Wonderland, Chinese Dragon, Dumbo's Circus, Cinderella's Ball, \"it's a small world\", and the American Finale. For the most part, the floats were two-dimensional, but some of them had three-dimensional elements or were completely 3-D.\n\nThe Main Street Electrical Parade was only meant to run for the summer of 1972. However, due to its popularity, the parade was extended through the busy summer and holiday months in 1974. In 1975, America on Parade, a giant tribute to the Bicent", "label": "real"}
{"text": "The worst political appointment of all time may have been that of James Brudenell, seventh Earl of Cardigan. After purchasing commissions as a lieutenant, captain, major, and lieutenant colonel—in the 19th century, you could buy your way up through the British army—Cardigan finally landed a gig as head of the famous Light Cavalry Brigade during the Crimean War in 1854. It cost him 40,000 pounds. It cost Britain the battle, its integrity, and the lives of more than 100 soldiers. After the war, Britain abolished the practice of selling commissions.\n\nBut in the United States, the practice is going strong. Not in the military, of course—in the diplomatic world. About two-thirds of ambassadorships currently go to career diplomats. The rest go to the president's friends, colleagues, and political donors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nPresident Obama continued this proud tradition Wednesday by appointing three top donors to ambassadorships. Louis Susman, a retired vice chairman of Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking, was nominated ambassador to Britain. (Fundraising for Obama: more than $500,000.) Former financial analyst Charles Rivkin ($100,000 to $200,000) will be America's man in Paris. And biotech lawyer John Roos (more than $500,000) will relocate to Tokyo. (In addition, theology professor Miguel Díaz and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer will head to the Vatican and New Delhi, respectively.)\n\nCareer diplomats have long pushed for better treatment. In 2000, candidate Al Gore pledged to reduce the number of noncareer officers in ambassadorships to 10 percent. During his campaign, Obama suggested he would not be doling out posts to the highest bidders. But more recently, he acknowledged that some of his ambassadors would be donors. \"It would be disingenuous for me to suggest that there are not going to be some excellent public servants, but who haven't come through the ranks of the civil service,\" he said in January.\n\nNo doubt the new political appointees can handle the job. Roos, as CEO of a global, technology-focused law firm, understands trade issues likely to arise in Japan. Rivkin has international experience as a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy. And Obama's appointee to Great Britain, Louis Susman, speaks fluent English.\n\nTo be fair, there's a long history of far less qualified people landing far cushier ambassadorships. In 2006, President Bush appointed his friend and fraternity brother Michael Wood to the post in Sweden. Ann Louise Wagner, former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, landed the Luxembourg spot in 2005. And President Reagan once appointed an ambassador to Australia whose chief qualification was selling used cars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThe swankiest gigs, according to former ambassadors, are the Scandinavian countries—Norway, Sweden, Finland—as well as Luxembourg and the Caribbean islands. But for the most part, any Western European country will do. Ronald Spiers, former ambassador to Turkey and Pakistan, remembers a conversation with a Navy admiral, who told him that after retiring he'd like to serve as ambassador to Spain. To which Spiers, a lifelong diplomat, responded that upon retiring he would like to command the Sixth Fleet. \"He didn't think it was funny,\" Spiers says. The admiral did, in fact, become ambassador to Spain. Spiers did not become an admiral.\n\nAmbassadors in paradise still have to manage their embassy staffs—or tell their deputies to do so. They also meet with leaders to discuss the ins and outs of, say, trade policy and report back to the State Department about what's going on. But they don't handle sensitive negotiations, like their counterparts in China and Afghanistan. One former nominee to the Bahamas, asked in his confirmation hearing what qualified him for the job, bragged about his golf game.\n\nWhen in Rome, ambassadors also take lots of vacation. A sampling of embassy records found that in 2006, U.S. ambassadors averaged just more than eight weeks off. Topping the list was the ambassador to Portugal, who took 58 days. But even when they're \"working,\" they don't necessarily have to stay put: Bush's envoy to the Netherlands, Roland Arnall, was out of the country 37 percent of the time. (The fact that his mortgage company was investigated by 30 state regulators may have played a role.)\n\nPolitical appointments can end badly. Reagan's appointee to Norway, Mark Austad, was known for getting drunk and chasing women around. \"We had to get rid of him,\" says Spiers, who handled State Department personnel at the time. Another ambassador, this one to Denmark years ago, was asked to resign after it became known that he kept two prostitutes in his residence. But deep embarrassment is rare. \"You usually develop a protection around them, to kind of isolate them from damage,\" says Spiers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nBut the argument against political appointees isn", "label": "real"}

With that performance, he, in my opinion, solidified himself as the third best RB in the draft.\n\nMeasurables\n\nDOB June 13, 1993 Bench (225 lb) 24 reps Height 5'9″ Vertical Jump 42.5″ Weight 205 lbs Broad Jump 130.0″ Arms 30″ 20 Yard Shuttle 3.95 sec Hands 8-5/8″ 3 Cone Drill 6.79 sec 40 Yard Dash 4.60 sec 60 Yard Shuttle 11.18 sec\n\nIn order to watch Abdullah, I went towhich has eleven of his college games.\n\nStats\n\nUniversity of Nebraska (2011-2014) 2014 264 att, 1611 yards, 6.1 ypc, 19 TDs 22 rec, 269 yards, 12.2 ypc, 3 TDs 2013 281 att, 1690 yards, 6.0 ypc, 9 TDs 26 rec, 232 yards, 8.1 ypc, 2 TDs 2012 226 att, 1137 yards, 5.0 ypc, 8 TDs 24 rec, 178 yards, 7.4 ypc, 2 TDs\n\nScouting Report\n\nHas maxed out his frame, he's not going to get any beefier. On the small side for RBs. This will limit him.\n\nTough, physical runner. Tenacity helps make up for lack of size, but still sometimes struggles between the tackles.\n\nDecent, not great speed. Isn't going to blow by defensive backs.\n\nWorks hard on runs, gets every inch possible out of them.\n\nNorth-South runner. Makes one cut and decisively turns upfield.\n\nExcellent vision for holes opening up at the LoS and second level.\n\nStrong stiff arm.\n\nAccelertates very quickly and bursts through holes.\n\nDoes a good job of getting to the edge of the defense and cutting upfield.\n\nGreat asset in the passing game. Strong after the catch.\n\nAlso spent time split out wide running WR routes. Catches with hands.\n\nVery elusive in the open field. Amazing jump cut, on the same level as LeSean McCoy's.\n\nNeeds work blocking. Because he is small he gets overpowered. Also iffy on cut blocks. Has some success, but it isn't one of his strengths.\n\nBall security is a big concern. 13 fumbles during his college career.\n\nFinishing Runs\n\nWhile Abdullah lacks ideal size, he certainly is tough. He bounces off of would-be tacklers, lowers his shoulder into defenders at the end of runs, and drives his legs to push piles. Effort is still a huge part of success in the NFL, and Abdullah displays tremendous effort on his tape.\n\nVision\n\nAbdullah has the best vision of the RBs in this class that I've seen so far, and it's not really close. He has a knack for finding cutback lanes and is also great at finding small creases to fit though and pick", "label": "real"}
{"text": "The Storage Spaces feature built into Windows allows you to combine multiple hard drives into a single virtual drive. It can mirror data across multiple drives for redundancy, or combine multiple physical drives into a single pool of storage. Storage Spaces is similar to RAID or LVM on Linux.\n\nThis feature was added in Windows 8, and was improved in Windows 10. It's available on all editions of Windows 8 and 10, including Home editions.\n\nWhat Are Storage Spaces?\n\nTo create a Storage Space, you need at least two physical drives on your PC. These can be internal drives or external drives connected via USB.\n\nStorage Spaces allow you to create a \"storage pool\" of two or more physical drives, grouping them together. Once you've created a storage pool made up of two or more physical drives, you can create three types of \"spaces\" using that pool:\n\nA simple space is designed to give you the most storage possible, but doesn't provide any protection against drive failure. Windows will store only a single copy of your data across all the drives. If one of these drives fails, your data will be lost and corrupted. This is ideal for temporary data.\n\nis designed to give you the most storage possible, but doesn't provide any protection against drive failure. Windows will store only a single copy of your data across all the drives. If one of these drives fails, your data will be lost and corrupted. This is ideal for temporary data. A mirror space is designed to protect you from drive failure by storing multiple copies of your files. A single drive—or more than one drive, depending on how you configure things—can fail and you won't lose any data. This is ideal for protecting important data from hardware failure.\n\nis designed to protect you from drive failure by storing multiple copies of your files. A single drive—or more than one drive, depending on how you configure things—can fail and you won't lose any data. This is ideal for protecting important data from hardware failure. A parity space is designed as a compromise. Windows will keep a single copy of your data along with parity information. You'll have more space and you'll be protected if a single drive fails. However, parity spaces are slower than simple and mirror spaces. This solution is ideal for data archival, and not data you use frequently.\n\nIf you choose to format a mirror or parity space with the Windows Resilient File System (ReFS), Windows will automatically monitor and maintain file integrity to prevent file corruption.\n\nHow to Create a Storage Space\n\nYou can create a Storage Space from the Control Panel. First, connect the drives you want to group together to your computer. Then, head to Control Panel > System and Security > Storage Spaces. You can also just search for \"Storage Spaces\" in your Start menu.\n\nClick the \"Create a new pool and storage space\" link to get started.\n\nSelect the drives you want to add to the pool and click \"Create Pool\" to create a storage pool from those drives.\n\nWarning: All data on the drives you select will be erased, so back up any important data before continuing!\n\nAfter creating a pool, you'll be prompted to configure your new storage space. Type a name for the storage space and select a drive letter. The storage space will appear with this name and drive letter in Windows.\n\nYou can select either the standard Windows NTFS file system or ReFS, the new resilient file system. If you'll be using mirroring or parity to protect against data loss, we recommend choosing ReFS for its file integrity protection features.\n\nYou'll need to choose a resiliency type. Select \"Simple (no resiliency)\" for a large pool of storage that provides no protection from drive failure. Select \"Two-way mirror\" to store two copies of your data across the drives or select \"Three-way mirror\" to store three copies of your data across the drives. Select \"Parity\" to be protected from a single drive failure and have more space, but remember that a parity space is noticeably slower than the other options here.\n\nYou'll also need to choose the size of your storage space here. The interface will show you the maximum available amount of storage you have, which will vary depending on the type of space you create.\n\nThis interface allows you to create pools of storage larger than the amount of physical storage space you have available. When the physical storage fills up, you can plug in another drive and take advantage of it with no additional configuration required.\n\nClick \"Create storage space\" when you're done configuring your storage space.\n\nHow to Use Storage Spaces\n\nThe storage space you created will appear as a standard drive under This PC, with the name and drive letter you configured. It appears no different from a normal, physical drive to Windows and the desktop programs you use.\n\nYou can do anything you'd do with a normal drive with", "label": "real"}

{"text": "The outcry began moments after Hearthstone released its Journey to Un'Goro expansion. \"The Rogue Quest is broken!\" cried out many of the game's players. While Shacknews was ahead of the curve on the potential havoc that The Caverns Below quest and the accompanying Crystal Core spell could wreak, many of Hearthstone's players were caught off-guard. The card appeared weak to them, but having seen it on the playing field, they were soon demanding a nerf.\n\nBut overreaction isn't Blizzard's game. The developer wants to wait for the meta to stabilize before making any hasty decisions. So with the new meta (and the new Standard season) a full month old, let's revisit The Caverns Below and Crystal Core and analyze a few key questions to see if action is worth asking for.\n\nIs the Quest itself broken?\n\nNow that the initial outrage has died down, this is an easy \"no.\" The Rogue has many tools at its disposal, but it's easy to forget about the tools that were lost in the change to the new Standard season. The Miracle Rogue decks took a massive beating with the Stealth-issuing Conceal moving to Wild, so that left room for a new Rogue deck strategy.\n\nThe Rogue quest has found a place in the ladder and in the pro meta because of the unlikely tools that it rides to success. Stonetusk Boar? Youthful Brewmaster? Who would have ever expected to see this in any kind of viable deck? The trouble with this is, as many Rank 20-10 players will attest, the deck is more likely to crap out than it is to succeed. Unless the Rogue draws enough cards with Return effects, the deck's minions are far too vulnerable to get wiped out before the quest conditions can be filled. This leaves the Rogue at the mercy of aggro decks, like the popular Pirate Warrior and the rising Beast Druid.\n\nOf course, when the quest hits, it hits hard and it's easy to feel like it's just plan broken. After all, what else can you say when an opponent is playing Crystal Core on Turn 3?\n\nSo then that leads to the next question.\n\nWhat other cards make the Rogue Quest feel broken?\n\nThis is another easy answer. It's Shadowstep and Preparation, two of the Rogue's long-standing staples. Since Crystal Core is technically a spell, Preparation discounts it to 2 mana, while Shadowstep can keep bringing minions back again and again for no cost. This is particularly brutal with Charge minions like that Stonetusk Boar or Southsea Deckhand.\n\nHere's where things turn complex. The overreaction to scenarios like repeated Boar rushes to the face is to nerf Shadowstep or Preparation by adjusting their mana cost. But given their functions, that doesn't make any sense. The spells wouldn't be viable anymore.\n\nThe alternative is to adjust their text to something along the lines of returned minions or discounted spells could only be played on the next turn. However, that wouldn't work either, given how many other Rogue decks rely on these spells. Why should Miracle Rogue be punished because a Quest Rogue keeps throwing a Boar at your face?\n\nSo nerfing the quest cards themselves and nerfing Shadowstep and Preparation are out of the question. And don't even bring up nerfing the 1 mana 1/1 Boar, because that's just silly. So then what isn't silly?\n\nShould the Return minions be nerfed?\n\nThis is getting closer. The Rogue quest works as well as it does because of the low cost of its \"return to hand\" minions. Youthful Brewmaster would have been more than enough to make the quest viable, but Gadgetzan Ferryman from the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan set is another 2 mana option that's too good to pass up.\n\nThis is where frustration can set in and where some of those \"nerf\" cries can stem from: Once a minion is safely back in the Rogue's hand, the player knows what's coming next and there's no effective way to stop it. Outside of the Mage's Counterspell (which can easily be baited out by any of the Rogue's low-cost spells), there's no way to stop that quest train. One good option to slow it down by upping the cost of some of these return minions.\n\nOther than that, many of the suggested fixes would just break the Rogue class and cause collateral damage. And it would all be to fix a deck type that falls on its face as much as it succeeds. It's likely Blizzard will eventually take action, but the Quest Rogue situation is not as dire as it looks. Because of that lack of urgency, Blizzard will be extra careful about deliberating any potential patch changes.\n\nShouldn't the quest just get nerfed anyway?\n\nThat's not an unreasonable question, because let's think about it in these terms. Even if the Quest Rogue", "label": "real"}
